								solution: "Feature teams could write their own docs!" It wasn't a
								popular suggestion among the feature team engineering leadership,
								but nobody else had a solution.</p> <p>To set the feature teams up for success, I helped the docs team
								put together resources to set the feature teams up for success:
								templates, examples, training sessions, and a review process. I
								worked with release management to make quality docs a gating
								factor for releasing features. That's one way to solve the
								philosophical question!</p> <p>This approach turned out to be the right solution long-term.
								Nobody knows a feature better than its author, and once the dev
								had written the meat of a doc they were able to pair with a writer
								on making it easier to find and understand. This culture change
								resulted in a longer-term trend towards better quality docs and
								better docs coverage.</p></div><!----><!--]--></div> <!----></div><!----><!----></div><!----> <div class="node svelte-1def9nf"><div class="mb-8 inline-block rounded-md border border-slate-100 p-6 svelte-1def9nf"><!--[--><h3 class="mt-0">Game Developer Services PM</h3><!----><!--]--> <!--[--><p>My next chapter at Microsoft was working on Xbox Live and PlayFab.

						intertwined with sensitive business information protected by NDA.</p><!----><!--]--></div> <div class="node svelte-1def9nf"><div class="mb-8 inline-block rounded-md border border-slate-100 p-6 svelte-1def9nf"><!--[--><h4 class="mt-0">The right defaults</h4><!----><!--]--> <!--[--><div><p>Smaller studios were running into issues with configuring their
								achievements. Sometimes they would realize it before release,
								other times it would be when players weren't getting achievements
								they were supposed to. Xbox Achievements are available in two
								flavors: <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/gaming/gdk/_content/gc/live/features/player-data/achievements/live-achievements-eb-vs-tm">event-based and title-managed</a>. Or more simply: the old complicated way and the new simple way.
								Unfortunately, most new titles were choosing the old complicated
								way.</p> <p>I did the obvious thing and updated the docs to make this really
								easy to figure out. A big banner that says "We recommend using
								title-managed Achievements to configure new titles." But of course
								nobody reads the docs. No measurable change. What else can be
								done?</p> <p>Second time at bat on this problem, I was curious what was going
								wrong. I tried setting up a demo title, and found my answer.
								Buried in a services config page was a radio selector with
								"event-based" pre-selected and "title-managed" underneath.</p> <p>Gave those two the ol' switcheroo and added a link to the docs as
								a cherry on top. The measure (support requests) was very lagging,
								so it took a months to be sure. Gradually, these configuration
								issues declined until months went by without seeing any of them.
								The right default made all the difference.</p></div><!----><!--]--></div> <!----></div><!----> <div class="node svelte-1def9nf"><div class="mb-8 inline-block rounded-md border border-slate-100 p-6 svelte-1def9nf"><!--[--><h4 class="mt-0">Consulting with Ikon Games</h4><!----><!--]--> <!--[--><div><p>Ikon was struggling with an ambitious game project and needed an
