							team and someone showed me how to find a download link for a
							compiled HTML file (.chm, pronounced &quot;chum&quot;) containing the docs.
							Fishy.</p> <p>This thing was undiscoverable, hidden behind an auth wall, and
							once I downloaded it I couldn&#39;t even search for any text content!
							No wonder nobody was finding answers in there.</p> <p>In my naivetÃ©, I thought the solution was obvious: put the docs
							on our good docs platform, docs.microsoft.com. Everyone told me it
							was impossible. There were certain details that just couldn&#39;t be
							made public.</p> <p>So I did what any reasonable person would do. I made a
							spreadsheet to track every single one of our thousands of doc
							pages, figured out who was responsible for each one, and got
							explicit sign off for every single page that could be made public.
							It took months, but in the end around 95% of the docs were cleared

							page, which still serves as <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/gaming/xbox/">the hub routing Xbox developers to the resources they need</a>. Most importantly, a developer can find them the easy way now:

							<br>&quot;If I release a feature and don&#39;t tell anyone how to use it
							in the docs, is it really released?&quot;</p> <p>The fancy new Xbox features were supposed to make the new games <em>look</em>
							and <em>feel</em> new. That only happens when developers use the features!</p> <p>With only 4 writers, the docs team was hopelessly outmatched by
							dozens of feature teams cranking out new capabilities for the new
							console. Even if we hired a bunch of new writers, we wouldn&#39;t be
							able to get on top of all the existing and expected docs work.
							Something had to change!</p> <p>There was really only one viable path forward after accounting
							for budget and timeline constraints. I had to propose the obvious
							solution: &quot;Feature teams could write their own docs!&quot; It wasn&#39;t a
							popular suggestion among the feature team engineering leadership,
							but nobody else had a solution.</p> <p>To set the feature teams up for success, I helped the docs team
							put together resources to set the feature teams up for success:
							templates, examples, training sessions, and a review process. I
							worked with release management to make quality docs a gating
							factor for releasing features. That&#39;s one way to solve the
							philosophical question!</p> <p>This approach turned out to be the right solution long-term.
							Nobody knows a feature better than its author, and once the dev
							had written the meat of a doc they were able to pair with a writer
							on making it easier to find and understand. This culture change
							resulted in a longer-term trend towards better quality docs and

					Officially, I was responsible for 10 services, but Achievements, game
					saves, and PlayFab&#39;s core were 95% of the work. Much of the work I did
					in this role is unfortunately not easy to share as it is deeply
					intertwined with sensitive business information protected by NDA.</p></div> <div class="node svelte-19eh20r"><div class="mb-8 inline-block rounded-md border border-slate-100 p-6 svelte-19eh20r"><h4 class="mt-0" slot="heading" data-svelte-h="svelte-1dir1ol">The right defaults</h4> <div slot="content" data-svelte-h="svelte-4qjdne"><p>Smaller studios were running into issues with configuring their
							achievements. Sometimes they would realize it before release,
							other times it would be when players weren&#39;t getting achievements
							they were supposed to. Xbox Achievements are available in two
							flavors: <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/gaming/gdk/_content/gc/live/features/player-data/achievements/live-achievements-eb-vs-tm">event-based and title-managed</a>. Or more simply: the old complicated way and the new simple way.
							Unfortunately, most new titles were choosing the old complicated
							way.</p> <p>I did the obvious thing and updated the docs to make this really
							easy to figure out. A big banner that says &quot;We recommend using
							title-managed Achievements to configure new titles.&quot; But of course
							nobody reads the docs. No measurable change. What else can be
							done?</p> <p>Second time at bat on this problem, I was curious what was going
							wrong. I tried setting up a demo title, and found my answer.
							Buried in a services config page was a radio selector with
							&quot;event-based&quot; pre-selected and &quot;title-managed&quot; underneath.</p> <p>Gave those two the ol&#39; switcheroo and added a link to the docs as
							a cherry on top. The measure (support requests) was very lagging,
							so it took a months to be sure. Gradually, these configuration
							issues declined until months went by without seeing any of them.
							The right default made all the difference.</p></div></div>  </div> <div class="node svelte-19eh20r"><div class="mb-8 inline-block rounded-md border border-slate-100 p-6 svelte-19eh20r"><h4 class="mt-0" slot="heading" data-svelte-h="svelte-5mnquy">Consulting with Ikon Games</h4> <div slot="content" data-svelte-h="svelte-43thxc"><p>Ikon was struggling with an ambitious game project and needed an
							infusion of cash and more experience shipping games. I had
							identified a market opportunity that was a perfect fit: short,
							inexpensive games centered around achievements for the
							&quot;Achievement Hunter&quot; audience. We were able to develop an
							achievement puzzle concept that leveraged Ikon&#39;s existing assets
							and ship two games in ~6 months.</p> <p>This bold new product strategy, combined with strategic creator
							partnerships proved extremely effective. The studio was able to
							reach over 50k viewers and convert ~30% of them. This strategy
							produced over 100K in profit for the studio.</p></div></div>  </div> </div> </div> <div class="node svelte-19eh20r"><div class="mb-8 inline-block rounded-md border border-slate-100 p-6 svelte-19eh20r"><h2 class="mt-0" slot="heading" data-svelte-h="svelte-ulilyb">Quantic MBA</h2> <p slot="content" data-svelte-h="svelte-bne9m">Having gone from a technical education to a role at the intersection of

						auctioning experience.
					</p><p>For the fine art niche, there was a ritzy aesthetic we wanted to
						deliver on. Working in MaterialUI made this difficult, as it&#39;s a
						strongly opinionated UI framework that made matching our designs

						engineer to see how far we could get with a rewrite using SvelteKit

						decided to adopt this stack for the main product. We ended up
						shipping features about 5x faster after this change.</p> <p>One of my responsibilities in this role was to hire and onboard new
						engineers. I created an efficient process for interviewing
						candidates that enabled us to rapidly fill roles as quickly as 1
						week from open req to start date. My team grew to be responsible for
						the entire auction product as well as DevOps and smart contracts
						across all 4 products.</p> <p>Our code review process was slow and manual. I set up Vercel to
						build and deploy all PR branches. This made it possible to get
						asynchronous design reviews and build confidence in the deployment
						among engineers. The lower cognitive load of reviewing helped us
						accelerate average PR reviews from 3 days to &lt;1 day. It also
						helped us catch design issues before they hit prod.</p></div></div>  </div> <div class="node svelte-19eh20r"><div class="mb-8 inline-block rounded-md border border-slate-100 p-6 svelte-19eh20r"><h3 slot="heading" class="mt-0" data-svelte-h="svelte-4spzdb">Head of Engineering &amp; Product</h3> <div slot="content" data-svelte-h="svelte-1q6yi9d"><p>In this role my responsibilities expanded broadly to work across the
