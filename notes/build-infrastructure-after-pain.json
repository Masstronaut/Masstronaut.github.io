That infrastructure - once built - can reduce the friction of the activity. There are a few problems with doing so too early though:</p>\n<ul><li>Building infrastructure for an activity is time taken away from actually <em>doing</em> the activity</li>\n<li>Without some experience doing the activity, itâ€™s hard to determine what infrastructure is truly valuable</li>\n<li>Building infrastructure isnâ€™t progress, whereas doing the activity is</li>\n<li>The activity may not be continued long term, and the infrastructure is unlikely to be a worthwhile investment in the short term</li></ul>\n<p>When lack of infrastructure becomes painful, it creates clarity about what problems the infrastructure needs to solve.  </p>\n<p>Once it becomes clear than an activity is going to continue, Automation unlocks progressively more meaningful problems.</p>","css":{"code":"","map":null},"head":"","href":"/notes/build-infrastructure-after-pain","component":{},"internalLinks":[]}
