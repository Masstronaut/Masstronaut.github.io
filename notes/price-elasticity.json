These types of goods are more likely to be <em>inelastic</em> because consumers have no alternative. </p>\n<p>The way a market is defined can also have a huge impact on price elasticity within that market. For example, demand for flights between major US cities may be inelastic - the distances are vast and the only alternatives are much more time consuming. In the Japan intra-city transit market, high speed rail is a viable <a href=\"/notes/consumer-demand\">substitute good</a>. In that market, the demand for flights is elastic.</p>\n<p>Price elasticity can also vary based on how long of a period is being analyzed. Day-to-day, demand for gasoline is inelastic; people still need to get to work and do errands. Over several decades as people will continue to adopt greener alternatives such as electric vehicles, micromobility, and improved public transit. This will increase the elasticity of <a href=\"/notes/consumer-demand\">consumer demand</a> for gas.</p>","css":{"code":"","map":null},"head":"","href":"/notes/price-elasticity","component":{}}
