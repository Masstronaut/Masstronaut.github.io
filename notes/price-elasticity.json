These types of goods are more likely to be <em>inelastic</em> because consumers have no alternative. </p>\n<p>Goods with no alternative tend to be <em>inelastic</em>.

They arenâ€™t essential.</p>\n<p>One rather unique type of good has an odd relationship with price. When an increase in price causes an <em>increase</em> in demand for a good, itâ€™s considered a <strong>Giffen good</strong>. </p>\n<h2 id=\"price-elasticity-in-context\"><a href=\"#price-elasticity-in-context\" aria-hidden=\"true\" tabindex=\"-1\"><span class=\"icon icon-link\"></span></a>Price elasticity in context</h2>\n<p>The way a market is defined can have a huge impact on price elasticity within that market. For example, demand for flights between major US cities may be inelastic - the distances are vast and the alternatives are much slower. In Japanâ€™s intercity transit market, high speed trains offer a fast alternative to flying; they are a <em>substitute good</em> for flights. In that market, the demand for flights is elastic.</p>\n<p>Price elasticity can also vary based on how long of a period is being analyzed. Day-to-day, demand for gasoline is inelastic; people still need to get to work and do errands. Over several decades more people will adopt greener alternatives like electric vehicles, micromobility, and improved public transit. This will increase the elasticity of <a href=\"/notes/consumer-demand\">consumer demand</a> for gas.</p>\n<h2 id=\"income-elasticity-of-demand\"><a href=\"#income-elasticity-of-demand\" aria-hidden=\"true\" tabindex=\"-1\"><span class=\"icon icon-link\"></span></a>Income elasticity of demand</h2>\n<p><a href=\"/notes/consumer-demand\">consumer demand</a> changes in response to price, but how sensitive a consumer is to price can also change. When you land a great new job with double the pay, the cost to eat out at your favorite restaurant doesnâ€™t change, but the frequency you do it might!</p>\n<p>The impact that spending power has on demand can be quantified using <strong>income elasticity of demand</strong> (IED). </p>\n<p>Income elasticity of demand is a formula that can be used to calculate how changes in income impact purchasing behavior. The formula for IED is <code>(% change in quantity demanded)/(% change in income)</code>. </p>\n<p>Much like with <em>Cross-Price Elasticity of Demand (CPED)</em>, the sign (positive or negative) of an <code>IED</code> value can be used to classify goods. </p>\n<p>Goods that have a <em>positive</em> income elasticity of demand are products that have increased demand when income increases. These are called <strong>normal goods</strong>. </p>\n<p>Some products see <em>decreased</em> demand when income goes up. They have <em>negative</em> income elasticity of demand values. These products are considered <strong>inferior goods</strong>. </p>\n<p>Demand for inferior goods typically decreases because thereâ€™s a better product that provides consumers with greater satisfaction - such as higher ply toilet paper.</p>","css":{"code":"","map":null},"head":"","href":"/notes/price-elasticity","component":{}}
