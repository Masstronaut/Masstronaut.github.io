These habits are almost entirely within your own control. Make sure you are in a good state before looking to solve other problems. Only quit on a good day.</p>\n<blockquote><p>Put on your own oxygen mask before helping others.</p></blockquote>\n<p>This is part of the safety briefing before every flight. It’s also excellent advice for life. Make sure you’ve got a solid foundation to build on.</p>\n<p>These are the simple (not easy, but simple) habits I’ve found to be most impactful to my physical and mental health. Solve for physical health first, then for mental health. A healthy body has the spare resources to power a healthy brain. These habits are in priority order, but you don’t need to finish one before starting the next.</p>\n<ol><li>😴📅 Consistent sleep schedule. Go to bed and get up at the same time every day, 7 days a week. 🔁 </li>\n<li>💦 Stay hydrated. Dehydration results in poor focus, physical discomforts, and myriad other issues. People often confuse thirst for hunger - when craving snacks, start with a glass of water. </li>\n<li>🥗 Healthy diet. What you eat is the fuel your body has for energy, self repair, and building improvements. Eat enough, but not too much. Great inputs ➡ great outputs. </li>\n<li>👟 Move your body. It didn’t evolve to sit at a desk all day. Do moderate to high intensity cardio, strength, or flexibility at least 30 minutes/day. 🏃‍ Running, 🏋️‍ lifting, and 🧘‍ yoga are the most direct options. Do <em>at minimum</em> an additional 30-60 minutes of light exercise per day, such as brisk walking. </li>\n<li>🧠 Quiet the mind, 👂 listen to the body. Meditate for at least 10 minutes daily. Integrate the practice of quieting the mind and enjoying the moment outside of the meditation practice - such as while eating, brushing your teeth, or drinking water.</li>\n<li>⚖ Choose to be happy. Happiness is a choice. Making that choice is a skill. The more practice you have, the easier it gets.</li></ol>","css":{"code":"","map":null},"head":"","href":"/notes/fundamental-habits","component":{}}
