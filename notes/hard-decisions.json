There may be nuanced tradeoffs that are hard to evaluate, such as living somewhere with a shorter commute or more space. If one of those is more important, there is a clearly superior choice and itâ€™s an easy decision. When both are valued similar, itâ€™s a hard decision. Flipping that equation reveals that when a decision is hard, itâ€™s because the options we have to choose from are of similar value.
