The risks form some decisions are easier to mitigate than others. Depending on whether or not they are reversible, decisions can be classified as type-1 or type-2.</p>\n<p>Type-1 decisions are 1-way decisions. After proceeding forward with them, there is no going back. The risks are much harder to mitigate as a result of this. </p>\n<p>Some examples of type-1 decisions are:</p>\n<ul><li>Terminating a relationship - whether with an employee, spouse, business partner, or otherwise.</li>\n<li>Selling a business</li>\n<li>Initiating a lawsuit</li></ul>\n<p>People tend to view most decisions as type-1, looking at the risk of what could happen if it goes wrong. Fortunately, most decisions are <em>not</em> type-1, but are instead type-2 decisions.</p>\n<p>Type-2 decisions are decisions which can be changed or even reversed. While they may feel hard to come back from, the decisions can be modified or undone, often with a modest investment of time and effort. </p>\n<p>Some examples of type-2 decisions are:</p>\n<ul><li>Making a career change into a new discipline or industry</li>\n<li>Starting a side hustle</li>\n<li>Creating a new pricing or Business model for a product or service.</li></ul>\n<p>As goals, priorities, and scale increase, decisions are increasingly treated as type-1 decisions. Realizing that many of them are type-2 decisions may make it easier to make more ambitious moves. </p>\n<p>Is there a type-2 decision in your life thatâ€™s being treated as a type-1 decision? Consider whether it makes sense to take the risk, knowing that it is possible to change or reverse it if things donâ€™t pan out. </p>","css":{"code":"","map":null},"head":"","href":"/notes/type-1-2-decisions","component":{},"internalLinks":[]}
