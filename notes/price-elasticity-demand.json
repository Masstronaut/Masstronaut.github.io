PED is used to mathematically measure <a href=\"/notes/price-elasticity\">Price elasticity</a>. </p>\n<p>The equation to calculate PED is: PED = (% change in <strong>Q</strong>uantity demanded)/(% change in <strong>P</strong>rice). </p>\n<p>Using the equation for PED helps analyze <a href=\"/notes/price-elasticity\">Price elasticity</a>. This is because PED makes analysis of demand change <strong>precise</strong>.  </p>\n<p>When demand is <em>elastic</em>, the % change in <strong>Q</strong>uantity demanded is not equal to the % change in <strong>P</strong>rice; itâ€™s greater. </p>\n<p>When demand is <em>inelastic</em>, the % change is <strong>Q</strong>uantity demanded is not the same as the % change in <strong>P</strong>rice; itâ€™s less. </p>\n<p>To calculate the change in <strong>Q</strong>uantity, use the <em>midpoint method</em>. Consider the following demand table:</p>\n<table><thead><tr><th align=\"right\">Price (<strong>P</strong>)</th>\n<th align=\"right\">Quantity Demanded (<strong>Q</strong>)</th></tr></thead>\n<tbody><tr><td align=\"right\">$5</td>\n<td align=\"right\">100</td></tr>\n<tr><td align=\"right\">$6</td>\n<td align=\"right\">90</td></tr>\n<tr><td align=\"right\">$7</td>\n<td align=\"right\">85</td></tr>\n<tr><td align=\"right\">$8</td>\n<td align=\"right\">60</td></tr>\n<tr><td align=\"right\">$9</td>\n<td align=\"right\">40</td></tr>\n<tr><td align=\"right\">$10</td>\n<td align=\"right\">5</td></tr></tbody></table>\n<p>Letâ€™s calculate the % change in <strong>Q</strong>uantity demanded when the price changes from $6 to $7 using the midpoint method. Use this formula to calculate the % change: <code>(Q2-Q1)/((Q2+Q1)/2)</code>. In friendlier terms, for two price points itâ€™s the difference in demand divided by the average (mean) demand of those prices. </p>\n<p>Using the data from our demand table, the equation looks like this: <code>(85-90)/((85+90)/2)</code> =&gt; <code>-5/(175/2)</code> =&gt; <code>-5.7%</code>.</p>\n<p>When calculating the percent change, itâ€™s not important whether itâ€™s a positive or negative percentage. We only need the <em>absolute value</em>. </p>\n<p>The same formula is used for calculating changes in price. For the demand table above, this would be: <code>($7-$6)/(($7+$6)/2)</code> =&gt; <code>$1/($6.5)</code> =&gt; ~<code>15.4%</code>.</p>\n<p>Bringing this all together, PED = <code>5.7%/15.4%</code> =&gt; <code>0.37</code>. The PED is less than 1 because the % change in price is greater than the % change in quantity. When PED is less than 1 it means demand is <em>inelastic</em>. </p>\n<p>When the % change in price and quantity are equal, the movement between those price points is <strong>unit elastic</strong>. </p>\n<p>When a change in price is <em>unit elastic</em>, the PED is exactly 1. </p>\n<p>If the Price elasticity of demand is greater than 1, the demand is <em>elastic</em>. </p>\n<p>The change in PED tends to correlate with the slope of a <a href=\"/notes/supply-demand\">demand curve</a>. The slope of the curve is not the same as PED, but can also be used as an indicator of <a href=\"/notes/price-elasticity\">price elasticity</a>.</p>","css":{"code":"","map":null},"head":"","href":"/notes/price-elasticity-demand","component":{}}
