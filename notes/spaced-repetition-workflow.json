By default, the flashcard tag is <code>flashcards</code>. Tags can be inserted into the body of the note using <code>#flashcards</code>. Since the fact that a note contains flashcards is metadata, I prefer to put it in the YAML Frontmatter of a note. Frontmatter must be at the start of a markdown file, and is started and ended by <code>---</code> on its own line. Hereâ€™s a basic example with no other metadata:</p>\n<pre class=\"language-yaml\"><!-- HTML_TAG_START --><code class=\"language-yaml\"><span class=\"token punctuation\">---</span>\n<span class=\"token key atrule\">tags</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">:</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">[</span>flashcards<span class=\"token punctuation\">]</span>\n<span class=\"token punctuation\">---</span></code><!-- HTML_TAG_END --></pre>\n<p>Flashcards can be separated into multiple decks. This can be helpful if you want to sort them by topic (such as biology, physics, CS, etc.), type (vocab, concepts, ideas, etc.) or some other method meaningful to you. Doing so is very simple - just append them to the end of the <code>flashcards</code> tag and use <code>/</code> to separate the hierarchy of the decks. For example:</p>\n<pre class=\"language-undefined\"><!-- HTML_TAG_START --><code class=\"language-undefined\">tags: [flashcards/subjects/math]</code><!-- HTML_TAG_END --></pre>\n<p>Would put notes in that file into a <code>math</code> deck that exists within a larger <code>subjects</code> deck.</p>\n<h3 id=\"authoring-notes-that-contain-flashcards\"><a href=\"#authoring-notes-that-contain-flashcards\" aria-hidden=\"true\" tabindex=\"-1\"><span class=\"icon icon-link\"></span></a>Authoring notes that contain flashcards</h3>\n<p>When authoring notes, insert flashcards whenever writing the key details of a topic that you wish to retain. One easy example is in a list with definitions or explanations. In these cases, Iâ€™ll typically <strong>bold</strong> the term, add a colon, the inline flashcard separator, and then the definition, like this:</p>\n<ul><li><strong>Inline flashcard</strong>:  Flashcards with both sides of the card defined on a single line, like this one.</li></ul>\n<p>Also use inline flashcards in small paragraphs that contain key information. The benefit of this is quickly apparent when it fills your flashcard deck with key information you want to retain.</p>\n<p>Make sure to continue writing ==on a new line== after using inline flashcards! Doing so ensures that extra content doesnâ€™t get added to the back of the card. ==Highlighting== text in a flashcard note creates a ==cloze deletion==. This type of flashcard will show all the surround context, with just the highlighted bit removed for you to recall. Very helpful for learning terms that are used in a sentence or for key info written in the middle of a sentence.</p>\n<h4 id=\"multi-line-flashcards\"><a href=\"#multi-line-flashcards\" aria-hidden=\"true\" tabindex=\"-1\"><span class=\"icon icon-link\"></span></a>Multi-line flashcards</h4>\n<p>Sometimes the answer to a question is longer than a single line. I find this is often the case for lists I want to retain (such as Cialdiniâ€™s principles of persuasion, Maslowâ€™s Hierarchy of Needs, or Bloomâ€™s taxonomy). For those, particularly the ordered ones, I like to note them as ordered lists. When reviewing a flashcard on them, I want the back side of my flashcard to be the list of all the items. This requires multi-line flashcards.</p>\n<p>How do I author multi-line flashcards?\n</p>\n<ol><li>Write the prompt that goes on the front of the card</li>\n<li>On a new line, add the multi-line flashcard separator :_:</li>\n<li>On a new line below the separator, write multiple lines of answer<ol><li>Avoid adding any blank lines within the content that belongs on the back of the flashcard</li></ol></li>\n<li>Add a blank line at the <strong>end</strong> of the flashcard.</li></ol>","css":{"code":"","map":null},"head":"","href":"/notes/spaced-repetition-workflow","component":{}}
