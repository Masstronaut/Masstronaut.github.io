To influence people into following advice lead them to ask for it with guiding questions. </p>\n<p>Instead of giving someone advice, ask them for advice on how others in a similar situation should tackle it. Doing so boosts their self esteem, making them responsible for the ideas they generate. Since people feel obligated to follow-through on their <em>Commitment and consistency</em>, they will be more likely to follow their own advice.</p>\n<p>When someone asks for advice, they are <em>more likely</em> to follow it than if the advice were unsolicited. </p>\n<p>Guiding people to ask for advice has 3 key benefits:\n:â€”:</p>\n<ol><li>It reduces the likelihood of them becoming defensive</li>\n<li><em>Unsolicited advice decreases the confidence of the recipient</em>. Conversely, asking them for advice <em>increases</em> their confidence.</li>\n<li>It helps <em>Bring the audience through the journey of a decision</em> </li></ol>\n<p>Even if thereâ€™s a clear solution, itâ€™s important for someone to go through the journey of discovering it. Doing so helps form the connection between the problem and the solution, increasing internalization and buy-in.</p>","css":{"code":"","map":null},"head":"","href":"/notes/ask-dont-tell/","component":{}}
