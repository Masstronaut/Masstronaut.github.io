For substitute and complementary goods, a price change for one good can impact demand for another.</p>\n<p><a href=\"/notes/price-elasticity/\">Price elasticity</a> measures how <a href=\"/notes/consumer-demand/\">consumer demand</a> responds to price changes. <a href=\"/notes/price-elasticity-demand/\">Price Elasticity of Demand (PED)</a> is used to quantify it mathematically. <a href=\"/notes/cross-price-elasticity/\">Cross-Price Elasticity of Demand (CPED)</a> does so across substitute goods.</p>\n<p>Profit is <code>total revenue</code> - <code>total costs</code>. The costs include cost of production.</p>\n<p><em>Economic choices</em> are decisions made when there are multiple options. This can be complicated by <em>Asymmetric information</em>, which is when the involved parties donâ€™t have equal knowledge.</p>\n<p>When <em>Economic choices</em> intersect with <em>scarcity</em>, there is a spectrum of options between choosing <em>only</em> one option or <em>only</em> the other option. That spectrum is the <em>Production Possibilities Frontier</em> (PPF).</p>\n<p>Buyers and sellers interact and transact in a <strong>market</strong>.  The economic factors that drive the exchange of goods and services in a free market are called <a href=\"/notes/market-forces/\">market forces</a>.</p>\n<p>To maximize the output of a market, producers minimize <a href=\"/notes/opportunity-cost/\">opportunity cost</a> by developing <em>specializations</em> that maximize their <em>comparative advantage</em>.</p>\n<p>There are four types of markets. The most fair are those with <em>perfect competition</em>. In reality, <em>perfect competition</em> is not common. If <em>barriers to entry</em> are very high, it can lead a <em>monopoly</em> or <em>oligopoly</em>. When competitors can easily enter and exit the market and provide <em>differentiated product</em>s, <em>monopolistic competition</em> is more likely.</p>\n<p>There also four <em>Types of goods</em>, categorized by whether or not they are <em>Rival goods</em> and <em>Excludable goods</em>. The four types are:</p>\n<ul><li><em>Private goods</em></li>\n<li><em>Club goods</em></li>\n<li><em>Public goods</em></li>\n<li><em>Common goods</em></li></ul>\n<p>When a transaction impacts parties not involved in the transaction, itâ€™s called an <em>Externality</em>. If <em>Coase Theorem</em> applies, a private solution can produce optimal results. Otherwise, a <em>public solution</em> such as <em>cap and trade</em> is necessary.</p>","css":{"code":"","map":null},"head":"","href":"/notes/microeconomics/","component":{}}
