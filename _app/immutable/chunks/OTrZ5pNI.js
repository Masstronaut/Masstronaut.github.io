All decisions about spending scarce resources - such as time or money - are *economic choices*. Each option comes at the cost of missing out on the alternatives;

* if I buy a coffee every day, I can't afford as many weekend trips.
* Going out with friends tonight means being less prepared for the test tomorrow morning.
* Making a down payment on a home will cause me to miss out on gains from investing that money in the stock market

The *opportunity cost* of an option is the:-:*most valuable alternative*.  <!--SR:!2022-06-11,115,290-->

Opportunity cost between two options is calculated by:-:*dividing* the value of the opportunities.  <!--SR:!2022-06-02,12,230-->

For example, if a farmer can produce 100kg of potatoes or 80kg of carrots, the opportunity cost of producing carrots is:-:\`(80kg carrots)/(100kg potatoes)\`. Producing .8kg of carrots carries an opportunity cost of 1kg of potatoes. <!--SR:!2022-06-06,110,290-->

A producer that can produce more of a good or service than their competitors has an:-:*absolute advantage*. <!--SR:!2022-06-09,113,290-->

When one producer has a lower opportunity cost to produce a good than their competitors, they have a:-:*comparative advantage*. <!--SR:!2022-06-12,116,290-->

When a producer focuses production on a good or service where they have a *comparative advantage*, the producer increases their:-:*specialization*. <!--SR:!2022-06-10,114,290-->
