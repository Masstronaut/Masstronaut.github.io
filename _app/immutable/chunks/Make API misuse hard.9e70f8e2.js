In C++, memory needs to be manually allocated and freed by the programmer; it’s extremely hard to get right, and every C++ programmer has struggled with issues that arise from doing it wrong. The <code>unique_ptr&lt;T&gt;</code> addresses this by taking sole custody of a memory block and freeing the memory when it leaves scope or is destructed. If you use a <code>unique_ptr&lt;T&gt;</code> to manage all the memory you allocate, you will not have a memory leak. It works correctly by default.

Everything in the game is created as a game object, and an object’s behavior is determined by which components are added to it. A component encapsulates both logic and the data it depends on. Often data is needed by multiple behaviors; the most common example is rendering and physics both needing to know where an object is. Components can read and write to each others’ data via the parent game object: <code>this.parent.get&lt;Component&gt;()</code>.",k,g,q="This API is simple, straightforward, and easy to use. Upon realizing you need to more data for a behavior, it makes it easy to just grab the data and get on with it. Unfortunately, it’s a terribly slow API for games, requiring at least two different cache misses - the parent, and the other component. Used sparingly this isn’t a problem, but used in many components on many game objects, it offers a convenient way to make every part of the game run slowly. Furthermore, the way the API is designed makes it impossible to avoid the cache misses; it’s performance dead-end that can’t be optimized! This API makes it easy to ruin a game’s performance; it’s a poor API design.",P,_,j='I found the idea of APIs limiting performance of game engines so fascinating I did a <a href="https://youtu.be/W3ViIBnTTKA" rel="nofollow">C++Now presentation on the topic</a>.
