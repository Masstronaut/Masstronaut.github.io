First, the output HTML changed and broke my query selectors - that was an easy fix. Slightly more interesting is that typescript code blocks that are augmented with type information by <a href="https://twoslash.netlify.app/" rel="nofollow">twoslash</a> processing. Previously I was selecting the <code>innerText</code> to grab only the code, but twoslash adds additional elements (and <code>innerText</code>) that contain the type information. I don’t want all of that on the clipboard when copying a code snippet! To fix this I put a <code>pre</code> element with the class <code>code-copy-target</code> after each code block rendered by shiki. I inject the raw code from my markdown code block into the <code>innerText</code> of that node. The copy button gets the text from that node instead of the pretty code block. I also set its display to hidden so it doesn’t disrupt the view of the page and won’t be read by screen readers. I also needed to escape a few characters like <code>&lt;</code> and <code>&gt;</code> with their HTML escape code equivalents so that code snippets with angle brackets don’t break the page HTML.</p> <h2 id="detailed-feedback-view-page"><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" href="#detailed-feedback-view-page"><span class="icon icon-link"></span></a><a href="#detailed-feedback-view-page" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"><span class="icon icon-link"></span></a>Detailed feedback view page</h2> <p><a href="https://penguinsight.com" rel="nofollow">Penguinsight</a> now has a page for viewing detailed information about feedback.

This week I’ve been working through Kent’s <a href="https://epicweb.dev" rel="nofollow">Epic Web Dev</a> course with a friend, and being reminded of how nice it is to have a working linter & formatter was the final straw.</p> <p>I finally got around to fixing the config for ESLint & Prettier on Penguinsight. This was more work than I expected; ESLint switched to a new <a href="https://eslint.org/docs/latest/extend/plugin-migration-flat-config" rel="nofollow">flat config</a> format which I’ve now adopted. I wasn’t able to upgrade to the latest ESLint 9.0.0 because <a href="https://github.com/typescript-eslint/typescript-eslint/issues/8211" rel="nofollow">typescript-eslint doesn’t support it yet</a>, but I did manage to get <a href="https://typescript-eslint.io/getting-started/typed-linting" rel="nofollow">linting with type information</a> working which helped me catch a few potential bugs already.</p> <p>For the full details, check out how I set up <a href="/notes/lint-format-svelte">Linting and formatting a svelte typescript project</a>.</p>',1);function M(t,a){const o=l(a,["children","$$slots","$$events","$$legacy"]);h(t,c(()=>o,e,{children:(i,f)=>{var n=p();d(16),r(i,n)},$$slots:{default:!0}}))}export{M as default,e as metadata};
