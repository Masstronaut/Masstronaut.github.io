The four actions framework is an analytical tool used to create new value curves on a [strategy canvas](strategy-canvas.md) that have the potential to be:-:[blue oceans](blue-ocean.md). <!--SR:!2023-05-14,360,230-->

The four actions framework is designed to facilitate thinking about these four actions:
:--: <!--SR:!2022-05-08,1,240-->

1. Eliminate
1. Reduce
1. Raise
1. Create <!--SR:!2022-05-22,160,290-->

These four actions can be displayed on a grid, called the *eliminate-reduce-raise-create (ERRC) grid*, to provide an organized way to create an easy view of a company's strategy.

## Eliminate

**Eliminate** actions identify [factors of competition](competition-factors.md) that:-:are taken for granted as required by incumbents in the industry, but could be *eliminated* entirely. <!--SR:!2023-06-25,438,290-->

The benefits of eliminating factors can help a business with:

* Managing operational overhead
* Reducing product & marketing costs
* Making a product more accessible to a new or existing [customer segment](customer-segment.md)

## Reduce

**Reduce** actions look at the [factors of competition](competition-factors.md) that:-:can be *reduced* below industry standards. <!--SR:!2023-06-29,442,290-->

Think about which factors might be *inhibiting* growth, but are assumed to be required by the industry.

## Raise

**Raise** actions identify the [factors of competition](competition-factors.md) which:-:should be *raised* above industry standards. <!--SR:!2022-09-21,282,310-->

Challenge your assumptions about the status quo. Is there an area the industry is currently undervaluing or under-investing in? Would putting greater emphasis lead to [value innovation](value-innovation.md) that might help your product succeed?

## Create

**Create** actions are about identifying [factors of competition](competition-factors.md):-:that don't currently exist in the industry and should be *created*. <!--SR:!2023-04-19,349,250-->

This is where creativity and vision are crucial. What new factors could be created to make a [blue ocean](blue-ocean.md) of opportunity and escape the [red ocean](red-ocean.md)'s competition?
