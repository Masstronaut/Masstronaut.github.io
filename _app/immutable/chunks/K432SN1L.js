The <a href="https://github.com/Masstronaut/typesafe-ts/blob/main/readme.md" rel="nofollow">typesafe-ts readme</a> has a lot more details, but here’s a quick summary:</p> <ul><li><strong><a href="https://github.com/Masstronaut/typesafe-ts/tree/main/src/optional" rel="nofollow">typesafe-ts/optional</a></strong>: Turns “maybe” values into something easy to work with, whether or not they are a value. Includes a tool to ensure it is used.</li> <li><strong><a href="https://github.com/Masstronaut/typesafe-ts/tree/main/src/result" rel="nofollow">typesafe-ts/result</a></strong>: Gives operations “worked” or “had an issue” outcomes, making issues explicit and issue-handling straightforward. Includes a tool to ensure it is used.</li> <li><strong><a href="https://github.com/Masstronaut/typesafe-ts/tree/main/src/brand" rel="nofollow">typesafe-ts/brand</a></strong>: Adds name tags to look-alike objects (UserId vs ProductId) so you never hand the wrong one to a function. Also provides a utility for clear error types.</li> <li><strong><a href="https://github.com/Masstronaut/typesafe-ts/tree/main/src/assert" rel="nofollow">typesafe-ts/assert</a></strong>: Compile-time checks that help confirm “are these types what I think they are?” I find them extremely useful for library & API development.</li></ul> <p>A big motivator in writing <code>typesafe-ts</code> is that I wanted these patterns for <a href="https://docduck.dev" rel="nofollow">Doc Duck</a>. Switching to using branded errors and <code>result</code> for all my code that could produce errors was a substantial amount of work. As a result, I’m much more confident the errors are being handled. I also went from ~3 custom error types to 9, and now explicitly handle more errors from Prisma, the database ORM I use. The change was around net 0 for lines of code, but now explicitly handles many more error cases. This makes me happy, because it means typesafe-ts provides a more concise or “expressive” way of writing code that may fail and handling it gracefully.</p> <!> <p>This month was pretty exciting for SeattleJS. For starters, we had the team behind a really cool collaborative markdown editing tool, <a href="https://moment.dev" rel="nofollow">moment</a> sponsor the meetup and give an interesting talk on collaborative editing. I’m always glad to have sponsors because it makes the event better for attendees and for the venue that hosts us. Sponsored meetups are typically better attended, and attendees are more engaged and stay longer because they don’t need to leave for food.</p> <p>Something else exciting happened at SeattleJS this month; we recorded the talks!</p> <ul><li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQF2da_mMrM" rel="nofollow">Building Cross-Platform Apps with Electron and React by Martin Barker</a></li> <li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtifU_nnJo0" rel="nofollow">Lies I was told about collaborative editing by Alex Clemmer</a></li></ul> <p>The recording quality has room to improve, and we have a bunch of ideas for how to do it. The most important bit is that we got started though! Every month speakers bestow our audience with a wealth of knowledge, and I’m thrilled we’ve started recording talks so they can be shared more broadly.</p>',1);function O(d,h){const p=w(h,["children","$$slots","$$events","$$legacy"]);v(d,b(()=>p,()=>n,{children:(m,I)=>{var a=$(),s=f(a);i(s,{id:"typesafe-ts",children:(e,u)=>{var t=k();o(e,t)},$$slots:{default:!0}});var c=g(s,8);i(c,{id:"seattlejs",children:(e,u)=>{r();var t=y("SeattleJS");o(e,t)},$$slots:{default:!0}}),r(8),o(m,a)},$$slots:{default:!0}}))}export{O as default,n as metadata};
