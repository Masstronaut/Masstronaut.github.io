The blue ocean is big, open, and empty - an ideal opportunity space for businesses. This is the premise of:-:[blue ocean strategy](blue-ocean-strategy.md)  <!--SR:!2024-07-29,802,330-->

Creating blue oceans can:

* Increase revenue potential
* Maximize profit
* Increase the likelihood of securing outside investment, such as venture capital funding

Blue oceans are markets that:-:haven't been created yet. <!--SR:!2025-03-18,982,330-->

Rather than competing directly in a crowded market, or [red ocean](red-ocean.md), [blue ocean strategy](blue-ocean-strategy.md) advocates for:-:using [value innovation](value-innovation.md) to create a new market with no competition. <!--SR:!2022-12-12,215,250-->

The new market doesn't need to be entirely unique. Similar to re-segmenting a market, a new [customer segment](customer-segment.md) can be created in an existing market, such as by:

* Creating a more luxurious version of a mass market product (Cirque du Soleil vs Barnum & Bailey)
* Creating a *Mass market* version of a luxury product (Android vs iPhone)

Creating a a new market creates a "blue ocean" of opportunity. Companies building a blue ocean are creating a previously untapped market without competitors - at least initially. This means that blue ocean companies also need to create *customers* since they don't exist yet.

[Blue ocean strategy](blue-ocean-strategy.md) is extremely lucrative. Blue ocean launches account for just **14% of launches**, but **61% of profits**. This is according to the "Blue ocean strategy" study by Kim, WC & Mauborgne, R in 2015 published by Harvard Business School publishing. Contrast that with the *86% of launches* categorized as [red ocean](red-ocean.md) that are generating only *39% of profits*.

Companies with focused strategies [eliminate or reduce](four-actions-framework.md) emphasis on some [factors of competition](competition-factors.md) compared to the rest of their industry. Increasing emphasis on some factors and cutting costs elsewhere is an important element of:-:[value innovation](value-innovation.md). <!--SR:!2024-02-29,585,280-->

To create a blue ocean, companies must move beyond the competition-based strategies of [red oceans](red-ocean.md). Tools like the [Strategy canvas](strategy-canvas.md) and [Four Actions framework](four-actions-framework.md) can help.
