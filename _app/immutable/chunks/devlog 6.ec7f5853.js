The decision was to have every page from my notes served on the route <code>https://allandeutsch.com/notes/{slug}/</code>. For a long time this wasn’t an issue, but recently I started writing weekly <a href="https://allandeutsch.com/devlog/" rel="nofollow">dev logs</a> like the one you are reading now! Since my devlogs are a periodical publication, I wanted them to stand alone in a separate place - <code>/devlog/{id}</code>. That was incompatible with the existing approach to publishing where notes lived under <code>/notes/{slug}/</code>. For the first couple couple weeks I manually copied over the devlogs into my site repo and while that worked fine, it left things to be desired. I had to manually update all the links, and I ended up finding a variety of other workarounds were needed to use functionality I’d already built for notes. It was finally time to improve my publishing pipeline to support more configurable page routes!',D,g,X="Now I can set a note’s slug to a nested route, such as <code>devlog/6</code> (this page!) and it goes through the normal note publishing pipeline with all my shiny features and gets published on the right URL! I also cleaned up the server code for getting from the slug of a requested page to the markdown file with its content. What used to be a brittle and buggy process has been smooth and reliable since the change went live.  Before I was loading up all the notes when the server started. That caused me headaches in a number of ways:",$,b,G="<li>If I updated a note after launching the dev server, I had to restart the server to render the new content. ick!</li> <li>My CICD pipeline recently started to ran out of RAM eagerly loading all my notes.
