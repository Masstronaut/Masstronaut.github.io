In [microeconomics](microeconomics.md), the benefit gained from an additional unit (such as a dollar, good, or service) is called:-:**marginal utility**. <!--SR:!2022-09-14,267,290-->

When the incremental value of "one more" unit decreases it is called:-:***diminishing* marginal utility**.  <!--SR:!2023-07-10,413,270-->

For example, a pay increase of $1/hr has high marginal utility for someone earning $10/hr, but a diminishing marginal utility as earnings go up. Someone making $10000/hr doesn't get much out of another $1/hr.

The marginal utility of a good can actually decrease so much that it becomes negative. Anyone who has been to an all-you-can-eat restaurant can understand this! If enough of a good is consumed at a negative marginal utility, it can cause the total [utility](utility.md) to become negative too. Once full, continuing to eat can make you sick - which is worse than eating nothing more!
