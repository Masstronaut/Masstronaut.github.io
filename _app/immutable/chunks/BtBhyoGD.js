The strategy canvas is an analytical tool for evaluating:-:business strategies within a market or industry.  <!--SR:!2023-01-09,214,210-->

Strategy canvases are great at surfacing insight about which [factors of competition](competition-factors.md) a company (or group of companies) are focused on. It does this by presenting a line chart with the axes set up so that:-:[factors of competition](competition-factors.md) (including price) are along the X axis and the emphasis a company places on those factors are along the Y axis.  <!--SR:!2023-11-03,512,290-->

Plotting a company on a strategy canvas creates a:-:**[value curve](value-curve.md)**.  <!--SR:!2022-08-20,38,210-->

Strategy canvases are used to help businesses identify:-:[blue ocean](blue-ocean.md) opportunities.  <!--SR:!2022-11-19,277,270-->

When an innovative company is plotted on the strategy canvas for a sector, it's likely that new [factors of competition](competition-factors.md)) will need to be added. These factors are new because the existing competitors have no emphasis on them. This signals an opportunity to create a [blue ocean](blue-ocean.md). It's common for innovators to drop the emphasis on some established [factors of competition](competition-factors.md) in their sector in favor of their unique new factors. Doing so makes it easier to escape the competition of a [red ocean](red-ocean.md).
