Sometimes while working from home I want to mix things up from the normal work environment at home. Cafes have many perks:

* drinks and small bites
* They smell fantastic
* People watching
* A change of atmosphere/vibe
* Moving to another location is an easy way to rebuild momentum

These are some of my favorite cafés in the Seattle area.
