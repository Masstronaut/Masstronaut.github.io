Go to bed and get up at the same time every day, 7 days a week. 🔁 Getting a full 8 hours is also crucial.

Dehydration results in poor focus, physical discomforts, and myriad other issues. People often confuse thirst for hunger - when craving snacks, start with a glass of water.</li> <li>🥗 Healthy diet. What you eat is the fuel your body has for energy, self repair, and building improvements. Eat enough, but not too much. Great inputs ➡ great outputs.</li> <li>👟 Move your body. It didn’t evolve to sit at a desk all day. Do moderate to high intensity cardio, strength, or flexibility at least 30 minutes/day. 🏃‍ Running, 🏋️‍ lifting, and 🧘‍ yoga are the most direct options. Do <em>at minimum</em> an additional 30-60 minutes of light exercise per day, such as brisk walking.</li> <li>🧠 Quiet the mind, 👂 listen to the body. Meditate for at least 10 minutes daily. Integrate the practice of quieting the mind and enjoying the moment outside of the meditation practice - such as while eating, brushing your teeth, or drinking water.</li> <li>⚖ Choose to be happy.
