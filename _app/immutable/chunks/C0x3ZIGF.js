Often, it’s not easy to do so in an existing project because something else is already in use that fills a similar role. A couple recent examples for me are:</p> <ul><li><a href="https://deno.land" rel="nofollow">Deno</a>, a <em>JavaScript</em>/<em>TypeScript</em> runtime and package manager</li> <li><a href="https://orm.drizzle.team/docs/overview" rel="nofollow">Drizzle ORM</a>, a <em>TypeScript</em> Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) tool with great performance that has syntax similar to SQL</li></ul> <p>Additionally, I learned about <a href="https://www.langchain.com/" rel="nofollow">LangChain and LangGraph</a> recently at <a href="https://cascadiajs.com/2024/" rel="nofollow">CascadiaJS</a> and was pretty excited to try my hand at building something with it. I had no need for it in my existing projects, though. Time to start a new project!</p> <p>I decided to use LangGraph to build an AI agent that orchestrates an AI-powered improv show. It runs on a Deno server that exposes a single endpoint that allows users to provide a skit topic, and then generates a few rounds of banter between some AI comedians on the topic. As the agent completes steps in its task, the progress is saved as a <code>Checkpoint</code> which I save in a database using Drizzle.</p> <p>The project isn’t deployed anywhere, but you can check out the code <a href="https://github.com/Masstronaut/langchain-endpoint" rel="nofollow">on my GitHub</a>. If you want a little improv skit of your own, the repo has some setup instructions in the readme.</p> <!> <p>On Sunday I was still in the learning mood, but didn’t feel like doing any serious programming work. So instead I decided to cave to some peer pressure (and YouTube algorithm recommendations) and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLsz00TDipIffreIaUNk64KxTIkQaGguqn" rel="nofollow">learn how to setup Neovim as an IDE</a>. The experience brought back fond memories of my time as an Arch Linux user, and now <a href="/notes/use-neovim">I use Neovim btw</a>. I was surprised to find that getting to a similar level of productivity with vim vs without takes very little time, and the rest is upside. Plus, editing text is <em>substantially</em> more fun using vim. As someone who spends most of the day typing, I believe it’s worth learning just to make the day more fun!</p>',1);function R(d,p){const m=w(p,["children","$$slots","$$events","$$legacy"]);b(d,y(()=>m,()=>l,{children:(h,$)=>{var s=I(),i=f(s);r(i,{id:"building-an-ai-improv-skit-generator",children:(e,c)=>{o();var t=n("Building an AI improv skit generator");a(e,t)},$$slots:{default:!0}});var u=v(i,12);r(u,{id:"learning-neovim",children:(e,c)=>{o();var t=n("Learning Neovim");a(e,t)},$$slots:{default:!0}}),o(2),a(h,s)},$$slots:{default:!0}}))}export{R as default,l as metadata};
