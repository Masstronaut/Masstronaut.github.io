realized in the future I’d want to revisit the journey. I decided to start
making a weekly devlog detailing what I did during the week, both for my
future self and for my friends who want to stay in the loop on what I’m up to.</p> <p>I hope my journey will inspire you to also start a weekly blogging practice! If you do, I’d love to hear about it.</p> <p>Typically these are structured with a personal update first, and then project & technical updates afterwards. This makes it more approachable for non-technical friends & family. When I want to go deeper on something technical, I’ll typically split it out into a standalone note and link to it from the devlog.</p> <h2 id="my-dev-logs"><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" href="#my-dev-logs"><span class="icon icon-link"></span></a><a href="#my-dev-logs" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"><span class="icon icon-link"></span></a>My dev logs</h2> <ul><li><a href="/devlog/11">devlog 11: Learning vim and neovim</a></li> <li><a href="/devlog/10">devlog 10: CascadiaJS</a></li> <li><a href="/devlog/9">devlog 9: Buildspace begins!</a></li> <li><a href="/devlog/8">devlog 8: Squeaky clean feedback UX</a></li> <li><a href="/devlog/7">devlog 7: More life</a></li> <li><a href="/devlog/6">devlog 6: routing overhaul</a></li> <li><a href="/devlog/5">devlog 5: back on stage!</a></li> <li><a href="/devlog/4">devlog 4: in glorious 5K</a></li> <li><a href="/devlog/3">devlog 3: now with more pixels</a></li> <li><a href="/devlog/2">devlog 2</a></li> <li><a href="/devlog/1">devlog 1</a></li> <li><a href="/devlog/0">devlog 0: init</a></li></ul>`,1);function D(a,l){const o=s(l,["children","$$slots","$$events","$$legacy"]);v(a,g(()=>o,e,{children:(i,p)=>{var t=h();n(8),r(i,t)},$$slots:{default:!0}}))}export{D as default,e as metadata};
