A value curve is the result of plotting a company on a [strategy canvas](strategy-canvas.md).

## Red ocean value curves

When a company and its competitors have similarly shaped or converging value curves, they are likely to be in a:-:[red ocean](red-ocean.md). <!--SR:!2023-02-17,387,310-->

## Blue ocean value curves

Two of the three [common traits of successful blue ocean strategies](traits-successful-blue-ocean-strategy.md) appear on a value curve. These make value curves an excellent way to identify a [Blue ocean strategy](blue-ocean-strategy.md). The traits are:-:**focus** and **divergence**.  <!--SR:!2023-10-20,566,311-->

A value curve with a small number of highly emphasized [factors of competition](competition-factors.md) implies a strategy with:-:**focus**. <!--SR:!2022-09-16,275,311-->

Value curves on a [strategy canvas](strategy-canvas.md) that are shaped differently than the rest of their industry indicate strategies with:-:*Divergence*. <!--SR:!2024-08-28,780,290-->

## Other insights from value curves

The cost of focusing on many [factors of competition](competition-factors.md) simultaneously needs to be justified. Good justifications for these costs include greater profits, substantial market share, and establishing or maintaining a moat to isolate against competition.

When a company is investing in features or [factors of competition](competition-factors.md) that provide limited incremental value for customers, the company may be:-:**over-delivering**. <!--SR:!2022-11-05,302,290-->

When a value curve shows high emphasis across many [factors of competition](competition-factors.md), it's an indicator that the company may be:-:*over-delivering* without benefit. <!--SR:!2022-08-23,253,290-->

When a company's value curve zig-zags across [the strategy canvas](strategy-canvas.md), it may mean they don't have:-:**a coherent strategy**. <!--SR:!2023-11-22,592,310-->
