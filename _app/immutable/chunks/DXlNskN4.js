Unlike a [blue ocean](blue-ocean.md), red oceans are packed with both:-:customers and competitors.  <!--SR:!2023-10-16,529,310-->

Red oceans are markets where the [customer segments](customer-segment.md) and the competitors that serve them are:-:already well established. <!--SR:!2024-04-21,713,310-->

Red ocean strategy tends to be competition-based. Success is benchmarked in comparison to the competitors in the space. This is because the competitors are all fighting for the same customers.

Typically companies competing in a red ocean are competing on:-:*cost* and *quality*. <!--SR:!2023-09-12,495,270-->

Innovations of the last century have contributed to an increase in red oceans. This has been caused by factors such as:

* Manufacturing innovation increased supply, causing downward pressure on prices
* Globalization has reduced the barriers for international competitors to serve customers globally, making competition global and creating more opportunity to [re-segment](customer-segment.md) markets or compete directly
