It didn’t evolve to sit at a desk all day. Do moderate to high intensity cardio, strength, or flexibility at least 30 minutes/day. 🏃‍ Running, 🏋️‍ lifting, and 🧘‍ yoga are the most direct options. Do <em>at minimum</em> an additional 30-60 minutes of light exercise per day, such as brisk walking.</li> <li>🧠 Quiet the mind, 👂 listen to the body. Meditate for at least 10 minutes daily.
