The <a href="https://github.com/Masstronaut/typesafe-ts/blob/main/readme.md" rel="nofollow">typesafe-ts readme</a> has a lot more details, but here’s a quick summary:</p> <ul><li><strong><a href="https://github.com/Masstronaut/typesafe-ts/tree/main/src/optional" rel="nofollow">typesafe-ts/optional</a></strong>: Turns “maybe” values into something easy to work with, whether or not they are a value. Includes a tool to ensure it is used.</li> <li><strong><a href="https://github.com/Masstronaut/typesafe-ts/tree/main/src/result" rel="nofollow">typesafe-ts/result</a></strong>: Gives operations “worked” or “had an issue” outcomes, making issues explicit and issue-handling straightforward. Includes a tool to ensure it is used.</li> <li><strong><a href="https://github.com/Masstronaut/typesafe-ts/tree/main/src/brand" rel="nofollow">typesafe-ts/brand</a></strong>: Adds name tags to look-alike objects (UserId vs ProductId) so you never hand the wrong one to a function. Also provides a utility for clear error types.</li> <li><strong><a href="https://github.com/Masstronaut/typesafe-ts/tree/main/src/assert" rel="nofollow">typesafe-ts/assert</a></strong>: Compile-time checks that help confirm “are these types what I think they are?” I find them extremely useful for library & API development.</li></ul> <p>A big motivator in writing <code>typesafe-ts</code> is that I wanted these patterns for <a href="https://docduck.dev" rel="nofollow">Doc Duck</a>. Switching to using branded errors and <code>result</code> for all my code that could produce errors was a substantial amount of work. As a result, I’m much more confident the errors are being handled. I also went from ~3 custom error types to 9, and now explicitly handle more errors from Prisma, the database ORM I use. The change was around net 0 for lines of code, but now explicitly handles many more error cases. This makes me happy, because it means typesafe-ts provides a more concise or “expressive” way of writing code that may fail and handling it gracefully.</p>',1);function D(t,s){const a=p(s,["children","$$slots","$$events","$$legacy"]);h(t,d(()=>a,()=>e,{children:(o,m)=>{var r=u();n(4),l(o,r)},$$slots:{default:!0}}))}export{D as default,e as metadata};
