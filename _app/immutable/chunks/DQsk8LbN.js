Cross-Price elasticity looks at [consumer demand](consumer-demand.md) and the [price elasticity](price-elasticity.md) across products.

Cross-Price Elasticity of Demand (CPED) differs from [Price Elasticity of Demand (PED)](price-elasticity-demand.md) because CPED measures the change in demand for a product caused by changes in price for:-:[ complementary and substitute goods](consumer-demand.md). <!--SR:!2024-01-21,610,310-->

The formula for calculating CPED is very similar to the formula for [PED](price-elasticity-demand.md). It differs in that the top and bottom of the equation are for separate products. It looks like this::-:\`CPED = (% change in Quantity of X demanded) / (% change in Price of Y).\` <!--SR:!2022-05-24,66,212-->

The sign (positive or negative) of a $CPED$ value provides some useful insights. It can be used to understand the relationship between the two goods and how [consumer demand](consumer-demand.md) for one impacts demand for the other.

When two goods have a *positive* $CPED$ value, it means they are:-:substitute goods (such as beef and pork). <!--SR:!2022-07-12,52,252-->

If two goods have a *negative* $CPED$ value, they are considered:-:complementary goods (like cake and icing). <!--SR:!2023-04-22,336,272-->
