I’m generally slow to upgrade packages unless it’s a security update, but these are technologies I’m interacting with daily. Notably:</p> <ul><li>TailwindCSS 4</li> <li>Svelte 5</li> <li>Vite 6</li></ul> <p>I’ve already started an overhaul to <a href="https://wealthy.fyi" rel="nofollow">wealthy.fyi</a> to use svelte 5, and found I was really missing some of the new features when working on my personal site (<a href="https://allandeutsch.com" rel="nofollow">allandeutsch.com</a>).</p> <p>Since this site is more substantial, the great package migration was a bit more involved. It took the better part of two days, aided by the svelte & tailwind migration scripts. As far as I can tell everything is working and looking roughly the same now. I wanted to quickly write up some of the changes, and potentially expand them into a blog post of their own if people are interested (let me know on <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/allandeutsch.com" rel="nofollow">bluesky</a>).</p> <p>Tailwind changes:</p> <ul><li>Config is now defined in CSS instead of JS/TS</li> <li>Tailwind shipped their own vite preprocessor, removing the need for postcss and <code>lang="postcss"</code> in <code>style</code> tags</li> <li>When using <code>@apply</code> in a svelte <code>style</code> tag to apply tailwind classes, it’s now required to <code>@reference "path/to/app.css"</code> to load tailwind</li> <li>Tailwind now uses CSS variables for design tokens (colors, sizes, etc.), so it’s possible to use them with css <code>var()</code> instead of the old <code>theme()</code> or <code>@apply</code> approaches. <strong>This has been most of the migration effort</strong>.</li></ul> <p>Svelte changes:</p> <ul><li>derived state using the old syntax (<code>$:</code>) would assign a new <em>value</em> when rerun, breaking referential equality. Now in Svelte 5, <code>$state()</code> and <code>$derived()</code> values are proxied. The wrapper maintains referential equality, so downstream updates don’t happen anymore.</li></ul>',1);function V(o,i){const l=g(i,["children","$$slots","$$events","$$legacy"]);f(o,m(()=>l,()=>s,{children:(n,y)=>{var e=v(),r=h(e);w(r,{id:"upgrading-this-site-to-tailwindcss-v4-and-svelte-5",children:(d,$)=>{a();var p=u("Upgrading this site to TailwindCSS v4 and Svelte 5");t(d,p)},$$slots:{default:!0}}),a(16),t(n,e)},$$slots:{default:!0}}))}export{V as default,s as metadata};
