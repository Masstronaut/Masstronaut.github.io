In a study by Daniel Mochon at University of Missouri, participants were split into three groups and asked to purchase DVD players.

|Group|Experiment|Result|
|-----|----------|------|
|1|Presented a Sony DVD player|9% interested in purchasing|
|2|Presented a Philips DVD player|10% interested in purchasing|
|3|Presented both DVD players|32% chose Sony, 34% chose Philips|

Participants that were presented a second choice were 6.5x more likely to exhibit an intent to buy.

The single-option aversion bias can be overcome by providing a second option which is clearly worse. The presence of the worse option makes it clear that the primary option isn't as bad, and the audience feels like they have a choice in making the decision.

In addition to single-option aversion, *Contrast effect bias* and *Extreme aversion bias* can also influence decision making. As a general rule, [present three options when driving consensus](three-options-consensus.md)
