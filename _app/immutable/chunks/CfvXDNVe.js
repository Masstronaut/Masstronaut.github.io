A value proposition is
:--:

1. How a product or service benefits the target customers
1. A statement describing those benefits <!--SR:2021-11-04,81,250-->
   Value is created by:-:solving customer problems or satisfying their wants & needs. <!--SR:!2022-10-10,293,270-->

To understand a product's value proposition, write *User stories* for the customer. User stories look at a product through the lens of the user to clarify:-:how it creates value for the user. <!--SR:!2022-06-02,41,190-->

Value can be delivered in many ways, such as:

* Newness (the first iPhone)
* Improvement (software update)
* Design/usability (nest thermostat that is easier to use)
* Social status (Gucci, Prada, Rolex, etc.)
* Convenience (faster, easier, better location, etc.)
* Novel experiences, (visiting a zoo or circus, attending a magic show, etc.)

Alex Hormozi has [a great framework](https://youtube.com/shorts/rqo2iPLwH9E) for generating ways to talk about the value proposition(s) of an offer when copywriting.

* Pluses - what are the benefits of the offering?
* Minuses - what pain points does the offering solve?

Then  take those and frame them with a variety of perspectives:

* Self - how will these things impact me directly
* Friends - how will my friends/family/wife/team perceive me
* Enemies/competitors - how will my competition perceive me
