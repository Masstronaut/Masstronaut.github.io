Value innovation is when companies:-:create a huge increase in value while simultaneously reducing costs.  <!--SR:!2024-08-09,811,330-->

Value innovation creates new offerings that are favorable to:-:both the business *and* its customers. <!--SR:!2022-08-11,216,270-->

Value innovation **makes competitors**:-:**irrelevant**. <!--SR:!2022-10-20,309,330-->

Value innovation is an important part of creating [blue oceans](blue-ocean.md). To do so successfully, avoid:

* Creating value without innovating. Doing so creates incremental gains and is insufficient to exit a [red ocean](red-ocean.md).
* Innovation without a dramatic increase in value. Doing so means continuing to compete with the existing competitors.

In a [red ocean](red-ocean.md) market, competitors typically compete on cost and quality. Value innovation competes on both simultaneously, disrupting the:-:**value-cost trade-off** - the idea that value and cost increase or decrease in tandem. <!--SR:!2024-06-21,709,270-->

The value-cost trade-off - which plagues competitive [red ocean](red-ocean.md) markets - is based on incremental changes:

* Greater value => greater cost
* Lower cost => lower value
