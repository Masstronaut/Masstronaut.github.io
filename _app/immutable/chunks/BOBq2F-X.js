*@Jerome Bruner* created a simple framework for thinking. In it there are 3 channels people use to think about things:

|Method|Description|
|------|-----------|
|Interactive|Thinking by doing|
|Visual|Thinking by seeing (recognition, comparison, etc.)|
|Symbolic|Thinking with language (logical reasoning)|

By switching from one channel to another or combining several of them together, complex ideas can be made easier to grasp. Using a more appropriate thinking channel can make *Unthinkable thoughts* thinkable. Imagine trying to do calculus or algebra without mathematical symbols! It turns out modern mathematics can be traced back to an interface improvement: moving from word problems to the symbolic logic enabled by the Arabic number system.

## Examples of channel switching to make thinking easier

* Symbolic -> Visual: Taking numbers (symbolic) and plotting them together on a chart (visual)
* Visual -> Interactive: A circuit diagram (visual) overlaid with frequency graphs that show the output for a given frequency (interactive)
* Interactive -> Symbolic: Math with an abacus (interactive) moving to mathematical notation (symbolic)

## shape rotation and words

@roon found that aptitude and personality tests lead to an exciting dichotomy of thinking aptitude:

1. People who can rotate shapes in their mind (applications thinking/tinkerers)
1. People who have strong language skills (theorists/abstraction)
