Market forces are the [microeconomics](microeconomics.md) factors that affect price, and therefore [supply and demand](supply-demand.md).

When the market price of a good exceeds the minimum price for a business to profit, it's called:-:**producer surplus**. \`Producer surplus = market price - minimum price\` <!--SR:!2022-05-25,99,290-->

When the maximum price a consumer is willing to pay for a good exceeds the market price, it's called:-:**consumer surplus**. \`Consumer surplus = maximum price - market price\` <!--SR:!2022-06-27,98,290-->

The *sum* of *consumer surplus* and *producer surplus* is used to calculate an:-:**economic surplus**. <!--SR:!2022-06-09,114,292-->

The producer, consumer, and economic surpluses can be calculated as the shaded area of the graph between the *demand curve* and the *supply curve*. It's to the left of the market price.

In a *free market*, the market price will eventually be:-:the **equilibrium point**. <!--SR:!2022-05-27,35,210-->

When supply and demand reach equilibrium in a free market, it maximizes the:-:**economic surplus**. <!--SR:!2022-05-29,103,272-->

Governments can also apply forces on the market through *Market intervention*.
