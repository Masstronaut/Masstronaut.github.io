As is the case with most *economic choices* in [microeconomics](microeconomics.md), consumer demand is often driven by price. Consumer sensitivity to price isn't fixed though! Their sensitivity to price varies from one product to another. The change in consumer demand for a product in response to price changes is called [price elasticity](price-elasticity.md). It can be quantified using [Price Elasticity of Demand (PED)](price-elasticity-demand.md).

Sometimes the exact good a consumer wants isn't available. If a recipe calls for cashews but the grocery store doesn't have any, a consumer may buy peanuts instead. In this case, the peanuts are considered a:-:**substitute good**. <!--SR:!2022-09-22,270,310-->

For a good (e.g. peanuts) to be a *substitute* for another good (e.g. cashews), demand for the good must increase in response to price increases for:-:the other good (e.g. cashews). <!--SR:!2023-12-19,577,294-->

When the value of one product (e.g. ice cream) is increased by another good (e.g. ice cream cones), they are considered:-:**complementary goods**. <!--SR:!2022-06-04,165,290-->

*Complementary goods* are also defined by their relationship around price. When the price of ice cream increases, demand for ice cream decreases. In response, the consumer demand for ice cream cones:-:decreases. <!--SR:!2022-05-31,161,290-->

[Cross-Price Elasticity of Demand (CPED)](cross-price-elasticity.md) is a technique for quantifying how changes to the price of one good impact the demand of another; it can also help with identifying whether the goods are *substitute* or *complementary*.

When a price increase for one good (such as yoga mats) has no impact on the price of another good (ice cream cones), they are considered:-:**independent goods**. <!--SR:!2022-08-02,73,250-->
