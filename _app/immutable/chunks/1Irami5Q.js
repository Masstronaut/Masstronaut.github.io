There are three traits that appear consistently across successful [blue ocean strategies](blue-ocean-strategy.md):

1. Focus
1. Divergence
1. A compelling tagline

Companies that put an emphasis on a small number of key [Factors of competition](competition-factors.md) are more likely to have a successful [Blue ocean](blue-ocean.md) strategy. This is because their strategy has:-:**focus**. <!--SR:!2022-09-26,287,330-->

When the [Factors of competition](competition-factors.md) emphasized by a company are not the industry norms, it's an indicator of a successful [blue ocean](blue-ocean.md) strategy. This characteristic of strategy is called:-:**divergence**.<!--SR:!2024-08-06,758,290-->

Companies with *focused* and *divergent* strategies need to convey their [value innovation](value-innovation.md) to customers. This is most easily accomplished using:-:**a compelling tagline**. <!--SR:!2022-09-19,152,230-->

A tagline is a short quip that accomplishes a subset of what a [positioning statement](positioning-statement.md) does.
