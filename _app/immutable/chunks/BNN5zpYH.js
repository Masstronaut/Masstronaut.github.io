To influence people into following advice lead them to ask for it with guiding questions.</p> <p>Instead of giving someone advice, ask them for advice on how others in a similar situation should tackle it. Doing so boosts their self esteem, making them responsible for the ideas they generate. Since people feel obligated to follow-through on their <em>Commitment and consistency</em>, they will be more likely to follow their own advice.</p> <p>When someone asks for advice, they are <em>more likely</em> to follow it than if the advice were unsolicited.</p> <p>Guiding people to ask for advice has 3 key benefits:
:–:</p> <ol><li>It reduces the likelihood of them becoming defensive</li> <li><em>Unsolicited advice decreases the confidence of the recipient</em>. Conversely, asking them for advice <em>increases</em> their confidence.</li> <li>It helps <em>Bring the audience through the journey of a decision</em></li></ol> <p>Even if there’s a clear solution, it’s important for someone to go through the journey of discovering it. Doing so helps form the connection between the problem and the solution, increasing internalization and buy-in.</p>`,1);function D(o,t){const i=d(t,["children","$$slots","$$events","$$legacy"]);m(o,c(()=>i,e,{children:(n,h)=>{var s=p();r(12),l(n,s)},$$slots:{default:!0}}))}export{D as default,e as metadata};
