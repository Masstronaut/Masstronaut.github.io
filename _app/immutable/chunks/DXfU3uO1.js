One night after working I was hungry and feeling creatively inspired, so I decided to cook dinner. I asked Maya to put on a playlist of cultural music from the culture she wanted dinner to be inspired by. [This playlist](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/37i9dQZF1DX5cO1uP1XC1g) started playing as I began to dice garlic, and off to the Middle East we went!

The dish draws on some traditional and modern flavors that I've encountered in Middle Eastern food.

The recipe is published here upon request. We enjoyed it, and I hope you enjoy it too!
