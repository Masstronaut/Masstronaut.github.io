After embarking on the adventure of trying to launch a new product solo, I
realized in the future I'd want to revisit the journey. I decided to start
making a weekly devlog detailing what I did during the week, both for my
future self and for my friends who want to stay in the loop on what I'm up to.

I hope my journey will inspire you to also start a dev blogging practice! If you do, I'd love to hear about it.

Typically these are structured with a personal update first, and then project & technical updates afterwards. This makes it more approachable for non-technical friends & family. When I want to go deeper on something technical, I'll typically split it out into a standalone note and link to it from the devlog.
