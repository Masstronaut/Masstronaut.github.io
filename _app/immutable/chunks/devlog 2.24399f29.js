We worked through a couple modules on form validation and accessibility. Most of it was refresher for me, but one new thing I learned is that form elements can have a <code>novalidate</code> attribute set. This is handy when using client-side validation with something like zod. Once JS is loaded on the page, using <code>novalidate</code> in a form stops the browser from handling validation, fully handing it over to JS. I think this is a great way to get the benefits of the browser when needed, and progressively enhance the experience with my own validation &amp; error handling if client-side JS is available.',A,T,V='This week is exciting to me for another reason! One of the most fulfilling things I’ve done as a software engineer is in fact not software engineering at all. As an undergrad student, I had the good fortune to be a volunteer at C++Now and a speaker at CppCon, two amazing C++ conferences. I also went on to present a talk a C++Now after graduating. My work as a PM moved me away from C++, so I haven’t been to a C++ conference since. I absolutely adored my time with the C++ committee and at conferences, though, and have yearned for something similar ever since. At Microsoft, I helped run conferences but was not a presenter in them. Recently I discovered that there is a Seattle JS meetup, and started attending their events. My very first time, one of the organizers asked people to submit presentation proposals even if it’s just a lightning talk, and so I did. This week, I’m thrilled to have been confirmed as a speaker at the May Seattle JS Meetup, where I will be presenting about <a href="/notes/branded-types">Branded Types</a> in TypeScript. This is my first time presenting a technical talk since 2018 and I’m absolutely jazzed to be doing it again!';return{c(){i=o("h1"),i.innerHTML=g,p=r(),u=o("h2"),u.innerHTML=s,c=r(),f=o("p"),f.textContent=B,H=r(),b=o("p"),b.textContent=O,L=r(),w=o("p"),w.textContent=U,P=r(),m=o("h2"),m.innerHTML=Z,D=r(),y=o("p"),y.textContent=F,S=r(),x=o("p"),x.textContent=G,z=r(),k=o("p"),k.textContent=R,j=r(),_=o("ul"),_.innerHTML=X,$=r(),C=o("p"),C.textContent=E,J=r(),v=o("h1"),v.innerHTML=K,W=r(),I=o("p"),I.innerHTML=Q,A=r(),T=o("p"),T.innerHTML=V,this.h()},l(e){i=l(e,"H1",{id:!0,"data-svelte-h":!0}),d(i)!=="svelte-1kvur7m"&&(i.innerHTML=g),p=h(e),u=l(e,"H2",{id:!0,"data-svelte-h":!0}),d(u)!=="svelte-1y22855"&&(u.innerHTML=s),c=h(e),f=l(e,"P",{"data-svelte-h":!0}),d(f)!=="svelte-13gtr1x"&&(f.textContent=B),H=h(e),b=l(e,"P",{"data-svelte-h":!0}),d(b)!=="svelte-up9w0k"&&(b.textContent=O),L=h(e),w=l(e,"P",{"data-svelte-h":!0}),d(w)!=="svelte-1bszceg"&&(w.textContent=U),P=h(e),m=l(e,"H2",{id:!0,"data-svelte-h":!0}),d(m)!=="svelte-6cd6u8"&&(m.innerHTML=Z),D=h(e),y=l(e,"P",{"data-svelte-h":!0}),d(y)!=="svelte-jav8bk"&&(y.textContent=F),S=h(e),x=l(e,"P",{"data-svelte-h":!0}),d(x)!=="svelte-qjmtlj"&&(x.textContent=G),z=h(e),k=l(e,"P",{"data-svelte-h":!0}),d(k)!=="svelte-v55t41"&&(k.textContent=R),j=h(e),_=l(e,"UL",{"data-svelte-h":!0}),d(_)!=="svelte-gd5dqx"&&(_.innerHTML=X),$=h(e),C=l(e,"P",{"data-svelte-h":!0}),d(C)!=="svelte-1u1s9xb"&&(C.textContent=E),J=h(e),v=l(e,"H1",{id:!0,"data-svelte-h":!0}),d(v)!=="svelte-1i1uzlg"&&(v.innerHTML=K),W=h(e),I=l(e,"P",{"data-svelte-h":!0}),d(I)!=="svelte-zas07m"&&(I.innerHTML=Q),A=h(e),T=l(e,"P",{"data-svelte-h":!0}),d(T)!=="svelte-16pm7dh"&&(T.innerHTML=V),this.h()},h(){q(i,"id","penguinsight"),q(u,"id","updating-the-branding-to-match-the-docs-vision"),q(m,"id","what-goes-into-a-landing-page"),q(v,"id","personal")},m(e,t){n(e,i,t),n(e,p,t),n(e,u,t),n(e,c,t),n(e,f,t),n(e,H,t),n(e,b,t),n(e,L,t),n(e,w,t),n(e,P,t),n(e,m,t),n(e,D,t),n(e,y,t),n(e,S,t),n(e,x,t),n(e,z,t),n(e,k,t),n(e,j,t),n(e,_,t),n(e,$,t),n(e,C,t),n(e,J,t),n(e,v,t),n(e,W,t),n(e,I,t),n(e,A,t),n(e,T,t)},p:ae,d(e){e&&(a(i),a(p),a(u),a(c),a(f),a(H),a(b),a(L),a(w),a(P),a(m),a(D),a(y),a(S),a(x),a(z),a(k),a(j),a(_),a($),a(C),a(J),a(v),a(W),a(I),a(A),a(T))}}}function ge(M){let i,g;const p=[M[0],te];let u={$$slots:{default:[fe]},$$scope:{ctx:M}};for(let s=0;s<p.length;s+=1)u=N(u,p[s]);return i=new pe({props:u}),{c(){oe(i.$$.fragment)},l(s){le(i.$$.fragment,s)},m(s,c){de(i,s,c),g=!0},p(s,[c]){const f=c&1?ce(p,[c&1&&ee(s[0]),c&0&&ee(te)]):{};c&2&&(f.$$scope={dirty:c,ctx:s}),i.$set(f)},i(s){g||(re(i.$$.fragment,s),g=!0)},o(s){he(i.$$.fragment,s),g=!1},d(s){ue(i,s)}}}const te={title:"devlog 2",description:"Branding and landing page updates for my startup, plus an exciting personal announcement!",slug:"devlog/2",publish:!0,lastmod:"2024-04-21T00:00:00.000Z",date:"2024-04-21T00:00:00.000Z",aliases:null,tags:["status/evergreen"],readTime:7,internalLinks:["/notes/branded-types"],flashcards:[]};function me(M,i,g){return M.$$set=p=>{g(0,i=N(N({},i),Y(p)))},i=Y(i),[i]}class xe extends ie{constructor(i){super(),se(this,i,me,ge,ne,{})}}export{xe as default,te as metadata};
