realized in the future I’d want to revisit the journey. I decided to start
making a weekly devlog detailing what I did during the week, both for my
future self and for my friends who want to stay in the loop on what I’m up to.</p> <p>I hope my journey will inspire you to also start a dev blogging practice! If you do, I’d love to hear about it.</p> <p>Typically these are structured with a personal update first, and then project & technical updates afterwards. This makes it more approachable for non-technical friends & family. When I want to go deeper on something technical, I’ll typically split it out into a standalone note and link to it from the devlog.</p> <!> <ul><li><em>devlog 13: Upgrading to tailwind v4 and Svelte v5</em></li> <li><a href="/devlog/12">devlog 12: What if MacOS were a linux system?</a></li> <li><a href="/devlog/11">devlog 11: Learning vim and neovim</a></li> <li><a href="/devlog/10">devlog 10: CascadiaJS</a></li> <li><a href="/devlog/9">devlog 9: Buildspace begins!</a></li> <li><a href="/devlog/8">devlog 8: Squeaky clean feedback UX</a></li> <li><a href="/devlog/7">devlog 7: More life</a></li> <li><a href="/devlog/6">devlog 6: routing overhaul</a></li> <li><a href="/devlog/5">devlog 5: back on stage!</a></li> <li><a href="/devlog/4">devlog 4: in glorious 5K</a></li> <li><a href="/devlog/3">devlog 3: now with more pixels</a></li> <li><a href="/devlog/2">devlog 2</a></li> <li><a href="/devlog/1">devlog 1</a></li> <li><a href="/devlog/0">devlog 0: init</a></li></ul>`,1);function q(t,i){const d=u(i,["children","$$slots","$$events","$$legacy"]);c(t,m(()=>d,()=>a,{children:(r,$)=>{var e=w(),s=h(p(e),6);y(s,{id:"my-dev-logs",children:(n,k)=>{o();var g=f("My dev logs");l(n,g)},$$slots:{default:!0}}),o(2),l(r,e)},$$slots:{default:!0}}))}export{q as default,a as metadata};
