This note provides an overview of my learnings from the [Quantic MBA](https://quantic.edu) course on [blue ocean](blue-ocean.md) strategy. Follow the linked notes for more depth on any topics that are of interest.

## Types of markets

**[Red oceans](red-ocean.md)** are packed full of both customers and competitors fighting over them. These are the markets that are already well established.

**[Blue oceans](blue-ocean.md)** are wide open and full of opportunity. These markets may not have been created yet, or are in their infancy with a small number of competitors and customers.

## Tools and techniques

**[Value innovation](value-innovation.md)** is when a company finds a way to simultaneously provide *more value* and *reduce costs*. This is key to moving from a [Red ocean](red-ocean.md) to a [blue ocean](blue-ocean.md).

A [Strategy canvas](strategy-canvas.md) is a tool that can help find opportunities for [value innovation](value-innovation.md). It shows [Factors of competition](competition-factors.md) for an industry and the emphasis companies place on those factors. The plot for each company is its [value curve](value-curve.md).

The [Four Actions framework](four-actions-framework.md) facilitates the development of a business strategy to create a [blue ocean](blue-ocean.md) using [value innovation](value-innovation.md).

There are some [common traits of successful blue ocean strategies](traits-successful-blue-ocean-strategy.md) which are easily identified once the [value curve](value-curve.md) for a variety of competitors in an industry have been plotted on a [Strategy canvas](strategy-canvas.md).
