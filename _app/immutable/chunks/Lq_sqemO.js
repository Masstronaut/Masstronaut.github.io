This was unusually easy since I am the only user; talk about putting the <em>personal</em> in personal computing!</p> <p>My ideal workflow for publishing is to author my notes in <a href="https://obsidian.md" rel="nofollow">Obsidian</a> on any device and control publishing them to my website using a frontmatter property in each note. Step by step, this looks something like:</p> <ol><li>I edit my notes locally on any device of my choice using Obsidian</li> <li>Sync notes across devices using automatic git backups</li> <li>I can add <code>publish: true</code> to any note’s frontmatter to <strong>opt-in</strong> to publishing the note (default to private)</li> <li>Git commits to my private notes repo triggers an automated workflow to build & deploy notes opted-in to publishing</li></ol> <!> <p>Because I want my notes to be private by default, they exist in their own private git repo. The SvelteKit code for this site is private, though I hope to open-source it one day. That leaves the site deployment, which is hosted using my GitHub account’s <a href="https://github.com/Masstronaut/Masstronaut.github.io" rel="nofollow">GitHub Pages repo</a> and pushed to automatically by my GitHub Actions workflow.</p> <p>Here’s an overview of what happens in the CI workflow:</p> <ol><li>Commits to either the private notes or private site code repos trigger a build</li> <li>The build action pulls the private notes and processes them for publishing: <ol><li>A python script deletes all notes not opted-in for publishing</li> <li>The remaining notes are run through <a href="https://github.com/zoni/obsidian-export" rel="nofollow">obsidian-export</a> to convert them from Obsidian markdown to <a href="https://commonmark.org/" rel="nofollow">Commonmark</a></li></ol></li> <li>The site’s SvelteKit code is pulled from another repo</li> <li>The processed notes are dumped into a <code>content</code> folder</li> <li>The SvelteKit site is built using the <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/@sveltejs/adapter-static" rel="nofollow">static adapter</a></li> <li>The completed build is pushed to my GitHub Pages repo</li></ol> <p>This entire process takes around 2 minutes from start to finish. I’ve noticed that sometimes GitHub takes another minute or two to distribute the latest build across the Pages CDN.</p> <!> <p>My build pipeline is fully automated, but that’s not the only piece. I generally don’t need to manually author commits, either. While I generally avoid committing broken code, notes don’t really have a broken state that would fail to compile. A half-written note is in a valid state for backing up to git, so notes are a great candidate for automatic git commits.</p> <p>I achieve automated commits in 2 ways, depending on the device. On a computer, I use the <a href="https://github.com/denolehov/obsidian-git" rel="nofollow">obisidian-git</a> plugin. It’s easy to set up and works great. I have it configured to automatically backup my notes to git every 30 minutes if there are any changes, and it provides a command to manually trigger a backup too.</p> <p>On mobile & tablet devices, though, it’s not so great. iOS and Android lack a native git client for the plugin to use, so it ships with a JS implementation of git that is very slow. I didn’t like this approach, so opted for a different workflow.</p> <p>On mobile & tablet, I use a combination of <a href="https://workingcopy.app/" rel="nofollow">Working Copy</a> as a git client and Apple Shortcuts to operate it. I have 2 shortcuts:</p> <ol><li>A button shortcut that replaces my Obsidian app icon. When tapped, it: <ol><li>Pulls the git repo containing my notes, then</li> <li>Launches obsidian once the pull is completed</li></ol></li> <li>An automated shortcut that pushes all changes to my notes repo when I leave the Obsidian app</li></ol> <p>I’ve found this setup makes it extremely easy to get content published and shared with people on demand.</p> <!> <p>The last detail worth covering is how I specify metadata for published notes. TL;DR: I use frontmatter.</p> <p>All the metadata on this and other notes is specified in the frontmatter. <a href="/notes/slugs-make-links-readable">Slugs make links readable</a>, so I specify my slugs in the frontmatter. For this note that frontmatter is <code>slug: publishing-this-site</code>. Really simple! I do similar for the created date, last modified date, title, description, etc. I use <a href="https://mdsvex.pngwn.io/" rel="nofollow">mdsvex</a> to process my markdown into svelte components, and it makes the frontmatter metadata available so I can easily use it when rendering the page.</p> <p>Hopefully this overview inspires you to build your own publishing pipeline and put the <em>personal</em> back in <em>personal computing</em>.
