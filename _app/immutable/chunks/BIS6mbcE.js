[Marginal utility](marginal-utility.md) is the value gained from having one more of something, such as another dollar or car.

[Supply and demand](supply-demand.md) is how production and consumption change in response to price.

[Consumer demand](consumer-demand.md) changes with price. For substitute and complementary goods, a price change for one good can impact demand for another.

[Price elasticity](price-elasticity.md) measures how [consumer demand](consumer-demand.md) responds to price changes. [Price Elasticity of Demand (PED)](price-elasticity-demand.md) is used to quantify it mathematically. [Cross-Price Elasticity of Demand (CPED)](cross-price-elasticity.md) does so across substitute goods.

Profit is \`total revenue\` - \`total costs\`. The costs include cost of production.

*Economic choices* are decisions made when there are multiple options. This can be complicated by *Asymmetric information*, which is when the involved parties don't have equal knowledge.

When *Economic choices* intersect with *scarcity*, there is a spectrum of options between choosing *only* one option or *only* the other option. That spectrum is the *Production Possibilities Frontier* (PPF).

Buyers and sellers interact and transact in a **market**.  The economic factors that drive the exchange of goods and services in a free market are called [market forces](market-forces.md).

To maximize the output of a market, producers minimize [opportunity cost](opportunity-cost.md) by developing *specializations* that maximize their *comparative advantage*.

There are four types of markets. The most fair are those with *perfect competition*. In reality, *perfect competition* is not common. If *barriers to entry* are very high, it can lead a *monopoly* or *oligopoly*. When competitors can easily enter and exit the market and provide *differentiated product*s, *monopolistic competition* is more likely.

There also four *Types of goods*, categorized by whether or not they are *Rival goods* and *Excludable goods*. The four types are:

* *Private goods*
* *Club goods*
* *Public goods*
* *Common goods*

When a transaction impacts parties not involved in the transaction, it's called an *Externality*. If *Coase Theorem* applies, a private solution can produce optimal results. Otherwise, a *public solution* such as *cap and trade* is necessary.
