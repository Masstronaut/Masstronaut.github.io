It doesn’t <em>print</em> money, which is done by the treasury.</p> <p>Central banks also control the <strong><em>money supply</em></strong>. Money supply is the quantity of money available.</p> <p>The <em>money supply</em> impacts <em>interest rates</em>. The greater the supply, the lower the <em>market price</em> - ie <em>interest rates</em>. Conversely, decreasing the money supply increases interest rates. This follows basic principles of <a href="/notes/supply-demand">supply and demand</a>.</p> <p>Typically, <em>The Federal Reserve</em> has 3 goals with its <em>Monetary policy</em>:</p> <ol><li>Maximize employment / minimize <em>unemployment</em></li> <li>Stabilize the price of money</li> <li>Moderate long-term interest rates</li></ol> <p><em>Central banks</em> control the money supply in three ways:</p> <ol><li>Setting the <em>Required reserve ratio</em></li> <li>Discount policy (the <em>Interest rate</em> for loans from the <em>Central bank</em> to commercial banks)</li> <li>Open market operations (buying and selling government bonds on the open market)</li></ol> <p>Central banks control the <em>money supply</em> by setting the <em>required reserve ratio (RRR)</em>. RRR governs the minimum ratio of deposits banks are required to keep as cash. The RRR limits how much money banks can loan out. Higher RRR => more cash in the reserves. By loaning out money, banks “create” money - money is credited to one customer without leaving the account of whoever deposited it! While this increases the <em>money supply</em>, it doesn’t create wealth.</p> <p>Loaned money can be re-deposited, then re-loaned at the rate allowed by the RRR infinitely. The limit to how much money can be created is limited; it can be calculated using the <em>Money multiplier</em>.</p> <p>The equation for the <em>Money multiplier</em> is <span class="math math-inline"><!></span>.</p> <p>The money market obeys <a href="/notes/supply-demand">supply and demand</a> just like any other good. The <em>market price</em> of money is the <em>interest rate</em> that banks pay to borrow from each other.</p> <p>Since the <em>central bank</em> has total control over the <em>money supply</em>, it’s not affected by <em>interest rates</em>. The <em>supply curve</em> is a vertical line.</p> <p>In the money market, the <em>equilibrium point</em> is when the money demanded is equal to the <em>money supplied</em>, and results in an equilibrium interest rate.</p> <p><strong>Expansionary</strong> <em>monetary policy</em> is used during a <em>recession</em> to increase <em>aggregate demand</em> to <em>Potential real GDP</em> and decrease <em>unemployment</em>.</p> <p><strong>Contractionary</strong> <em>monetary policy</em> is used when <em>inflation rates</em> are high. By decreasing the <em>money supply</em>, they increase the <em>interest rate</em> to decrease <em>aggregate demand</em>.</p> <h2 id="quantity-theory-of-money"><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" href="#quantity-theory-of-money"><span class="icon icon-link"></span></a><a href="#quantity-theory-of-money" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"><span class="icon icon-link"></span></a>Quantity theory of money</h2> <p>The <em>quantity theory of money</em> states that there is a directly proportional relationship between the <em>money supply</em> and <em>inflation rate</em>.</p> <p>Under the <em>quantity theory of money</em>:</p> <ol><li><em>Inflation</em> occurs when the <em>money supply</em> grows faster than output - the <em>aggregate supply</em></li> <li>Deflation occurs when the <em>money supply</em> grows <em>slower</em> than <em>aggregate supply</em></li></ol>',1);function Z(r,l){const p=f(l,["children","$$slots","$$events","$$legacy"]);b(r,_(()=>p,m,{children:(h,k)=>{var e=w(),t=s(u(e),18),a=s(n(t),3),y=n(a);g(y,()=>'<span class="katex"><span class="katex-mathml"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mfrac><mn>1</mn><mrow><mi>R</mi><mi>R</mi><mi>R</mi></mrow></mfrac></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">\\frac{1}{RRR}</annotation></semantics></math></span><span class="katex-html" aria-hidden="true"><span class="base"><span class="strut" style="height:1.1901em;vertical-align:-0.345em;"></span><span class="mord"><span class="mopen nulldelimiter"></span><span class="mfrac"><span class="vlist-t vlist-t2"><span class="vlist-r"><span class="vlist" style="height:0.8451em;"><span style="top:-2.655em;"><span class="pstrut" style="height:3em;"></span><span class="sizing reset-size6 size3 mtight"><span class="mord mtight"><span class="mord mathnormal mtight" style="margin-right:0.00773em;">RRR</span></span></span></span><span style="top:-3.23em;"><span class="pstrut" style="height:3em;"></span><span class="frac-line" style="border-bottom-width:0.04em;"></span></span><span style="top:-3.394em;"><span class="pstrut" style="height:3em;"></span><span class="sizing reset-size6 size3 mtight"><span class="mord mtight"><span class="mord mtight">1</span></span></span></span></span><span class="vlist-s">​</span></span><span class="vlist-r"><span class="vlist" style="height:0.345em;"><span></span></span></span></span></span><span class="mclose nulldelimiter"></span></span></span></span></span>'),i(a),o(),i(t),o(18),d(h,e)},$$slots:{default:!0}}))}export{Z as default,m as metadata};
