This is an idea *Louis* shared with me which I have start noticed frequently. It's similar @RayDalio's idea that situations are common and we should therefore develop Principles that help us handle these situations.

A similar notion (also from *Louis*) is that things rhyme but don't repeat. The meaning is that many situations sound similar, but aren't exactly the same. Identifying the rhyme makes it easier to effectively navigate these situations.

## Real-world examples

My daily journal practice splits my life into a series of 1-day Agile sprints, which are in turn a specific implementation of [The learning process](learning-process.md).
