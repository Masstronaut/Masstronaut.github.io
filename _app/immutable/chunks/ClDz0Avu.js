By default, the flashcard tag is <code>flashcards</code>. Tags can be inserted into the body of the note using <code>#flashcards</code>. Since the fact that a note contains flashcards is metadata, I prefer to put it in the <em>YAML Frontmatter</em> of a note. Frontmatter must be at the start of a markdown file, and is started and ended by <code>---</code> on its own line. Here’s a basic example with no other metadata:</p> <!><!> <p>Flashcards can be separated into multiple decks. This can be helpful if you want to sort them by topic (such as biology, physics, CS, etc.), type (vocab, concepts, ideas, etc.) or some other method meaningful to you. Doing so is very simple - just append them to the end of the <code>flashcards</code> tag and use <code>/</code> to separate the hierarchy of the decks. For example:</p> <!><!> <p>Would put notes in that file into a <code>math</code> deck that exists within a larger <code>subjects</code> deck.</p> <!> <p>When authoring notes, insert flashcards whenever writing the key details of a topic that you wish to retain. One easy example is in a list with definitions or explanations. In these cases, I’ll typically <strong>bold</strong> the term, add a colon, the inline flashcard separator, and then the definition, like this:</p> <ul><li><strong>Inline flashcard</strong>:  Flashcards with both sides of the card defined on a single line, like this one.</li></ul> <p>Also use inline flashcards in small paragraphs that contain key information. The benefit of this is quickly apparent when it fills your flashcard deck with key information you want to retain.</p> <p>Make sure to continue writing <em>on a new line</em> after using inline flashcards! Doing so ensures that extra content doesn’t get added to the back of the card. ==Highlighting== text in a flashcard note creates a ==cloze deletion==. This type of flashcard will show all the surround context, with just the highlighted bit removed for you to recall. Very helpful for learning terms that are used in a sentence or for key info written in the middle of a sentence.</p> <!> <p>Sometimes the answer to a question is longer than a single line. I find this is often the case for lists I want to retain (such as <em>Cialdini’s principles of persuasion</em>, <em>Hierarchy of Needs</em>, or <em>Bloom’s taxonomy</em>). For those, particularly the ordered ones, I like to note them as ordered lists. When reviewing a flashcard on them, I want the back side of my flashcard to be the list of all the items. This requires multi-line flashcards.</p> <p>How do I author multi-line flashcards?
