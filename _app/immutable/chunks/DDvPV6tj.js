Guiding ideas:

* Play with the volume and openness of the loft
* lean into the unique character of the building (brick, green windows, exposed beams, industrial history)
* Play with elements that can have mixed uses, such as:
  * A desk that hides away under a murphy bed
  * An extensive island that is a work surface, dining area, and general table space
  * Stairs that are also storage
  * Seating that is also storage
  * A room that can be opened or subdivided using a partition (for office and/or guest spaces)
* We love to host and entertain and want a space that can accommodate a range of scenarios:
  * Small & medium group dinners (4-8 people)
  * Happy hour with ~10-15 people on the main floor
  * Summer BBQ with 20 people on the rooftop
  * A friend or couple visiting us for 2-7 days from out of town
  * A younger sibling (teenager) visiting for 2 weeks
  * a parent and 2 teenagers visiting for a long weekend
  * adapting to us having 2 kids
* We want it to be easy to keep our space feeling uncluttered
* Utilize interstitial space to create delight
* Aesthetics we like are:
  * Japanese & scandi minimalism
  * Tulum-style organic materials and lush greenery
  * Space age retrofuturism (think Space needle, the jetsons)
  * mid-century
  * art deco

Major goals (priority ordered):

1. P0 Master bedroom with 4 walls and a door\\* that closes and locks
   * Door could be pocket, barn, etc. Doesn't matter. Any door will do.
1. P0 Easy to clean primary bathroom with walk-in shower & ample built-in storage
1. P0 Substantially increase the amount of closed & built-in storage
1. P0 Chef's kitchen with expansive counter space (island extends into counter height dining)
1. P0 Main floor powder room
1. P0 Add an office room with 4 walls and a door, plus a murphy bed for guests
1. P0 Design the space to grow with our family and support 1-2 young kids
1. P0 Enclosed space for the cat litter with a cat-sized door
1. P1 ~Half of the rooftop being usable year-round
   * covered from rain & wind
   * heated during the cold
   * still nice in summer when it's sunny and warm out
   * can be opened to feel like a single large space
   * Unsure if this is possible due to floating decking and historical categorization of building
1. P2  sink outside the powder room near the front door
1. P2 Expand the powder room to a .75 bath

Minor goals:

* P0 Visually quieter dining area
* P0 Dedicated coffee station, ideally that can be closed/hidden when not in use (appliance garage?)
* P0 Hide washer/dryer behind a door
* P1 Entryway coat closet
* P1 More shoe storage in the entryway
* P1 An additional workspace suitable for taking video calls
  * Can be closed to reduce noise leaking everywhere
  * Could be the rooftop space 👀
* P1 Air conditioning
* P1 Radiant floor heating
* P2 TV out of the living room or not visible when not in use
* P2 improve noise dampening in the unit
* P2 Robot vacuum garage

Pie in the sky ideas:

* If we moved the staircase to the living room, we could extend the 2nd floor where the stairs currently are and make that space a bedroom
* If we moved the entry door, we could put another bathroom below the current one which simplifies plumbing and the awkward space layout
* Built-in cabinetry covering the wall from entry to brick would probably be a dramatic improvement. Should include a murphy bed
* We need to replace the flooring. Since we'll tear it up anyway, we could plumb the island with water, gas, and electricity and do radiant floor heating

* I love the combination of green and warm earthy tones to make it feel alive in a space with no natural light
* The circular fluted glass windows with gold panes are stunning
* Having multiple soft and diffused light sources is very nice
* The utilization of space is excellent
* Built-in storage in the shower + hooks for towels are great
* faucet off the counter seems like it would be amazing for cleaning
* Missed opportunity to have additional under-sink storage

* I like the combination of light woods, concrete, and plants to blend urban industrialism with nature.
* Dislike that all the shelves are open; it's visually overwhelming on multiple levels
* I like that this storage area is quite large and looks like. a feature wall when closed
* the concrete in front of the doors would make a nice bench with a cushion on it

* I like the use of elevation changes here to create different zones of the entryway. In Japan, homes traditionally have a "genkan" - a sunken area for removing and putting on shoes
* The big komatsu stone slab step is beautiful
* I like the huge built-in storage that also functions as a bench to take shoes on/off

* I like the soft warm lighting that is diffused from behind a wall
* The down lighting highlights the beautiful texture of the stone

![image](https://img.allandeutsch.com/allandeutschcom-note-images/34c32f46aaaed0ed33a5282d2e698398.png)

* The smooth stones as a flooring material are beautiful, peaceful, and a nice texture to walk on in small amounts
* I worry the cats might get the wrong idea, though...

![image](https://img.allandeutsch.com/allandeutschcom-note-images/c2eeb595172b523dbcaf8f54f4b72461.png)

* The finishes are sleek, minimal, and visually quiet
* The surfaces are all flat, so cleaning should be a breeze
* I dislike the light strip being visible, would've been much nicer to have it recessed
* It's too dark
* I like the fridge doors & dishwasher being paneled to match the cabinetry and sit flush with it

![image](https://img.allandeutsch.com/allandeutschcom-note-images/d1562c787f76145855f5ca4251fa7246.png)

* All the artificial lighting here is diffused
  * the light strips on the right ceiling is behind the wall
  * The floor lighting is diffused under the media stand/shelf
  * the spot lights on the left are pointed up and bounced off the ceiling
* The sunken living room makes it feel more cozy and intimate for such a voluminous space
* at the far side, the elevation change is used to create opportunity for built-in storage
* The TV is very subtle as a result of the wall being black 👍
* I dislike how much visual noise there is from stairways and hand rails

* I like how much storage these vanities have, without feeling like ugly storage vanities
* the vanity protruding seems nice for makeup, skin care, etc.
* Having the faucet off the counter is very nice

* I love that all the walls are wood instead of drywall

![image](https://img.allandeutsch.com/allandeutschcom-note-images/4a57fc5b1bc9c14dcae990579ef7e54c.png)

* I love how organic everything in this room feels. The lights, floor, wall, arched ceiling, chairs, and back wall

![image](https://img.allandeutsch.com/allandeutschcom-note-images/d0b9d31a0eb9fca52b03d4a7d613d97b.png)

* A sink to wash your hands right when you come in is fantastic

![image](https://img.allandeutsch.com/allandeutschcom-note-images/5c4964b3b8606b909dae82b1e94ce0ea.png)

* The uplighting on wood + a matching wood panel in front to hide the light source looks great
* I like the combo of warm/light gray stone + light wood

![image](https://img.allandeutsch.com/allandeutschcom-note-images/f2890e7653d2ed5fe34b833e8cb013b1.png)

* I like the use of pocket doors for the bathroom and office space (office is on the main floor, left of bathroom)
* The tiny dedicated office space with a door and built-in desk is perfect
* The small loft space above the office seems like a wonderful place to curl up with a book, favorite record, or wind down with some yoga before bed

![image](https://img.allandeutsch.com/allandeutschcom-note-images/5d4e3c0e599fb11f19a6e20aefda9169.png)

* Hiding the TV behind wall panels is great. Makes it easy to hide all the cables too
* I like that the wall is on top of the floor with no trim

![image](https://img.allandeutsch.com/allandeutschcom-note-images/f68b0cbf23e858c7cb1bf74b3db7a55f.png)

* Uplighting hidden behind the headboard is really nice night lighting
* uplighting on wood slats looks great

### Other misc inspiration

* I like that this staircase has built-in storage utilizing the full under-stair space
* I like that the loft is treated as a sculptural detail

![image](https://img.allandeutsch.com/allandeutschcom-note-images/9095a99575e76c97755ec3cfee6b3359.jpeg)

* I like the use of smooth river stones visually, and their use here to fill the dead space is nice (no dead space would be better of course)

![image](https://img.allandeutsch.com/allandeutschcom-note-images/5cdf09a6908b065f8be656dc545c1d51.png)

* I like the serene setting surrounded by greenery with low lighting
* Moving water in the home is a lovely feature. I enjoy the sound of moving water
* The modern japanese aesthetic is beautiful
* I'd like to explore floor seating or very low seating (such as togo chairs, knotty chairs, floor cushions)

![image](https://img.allandeutsch.com/allandeutschcom-note-images/9937d5ca0b5c4d978d6f5512f8bcdce3.png)

* I find the layers of organic materials in light tones very soothing
* The round rug and rounded baskets soften a space otherwise full of hard right angles

![image](https://img.allandeutsch.com/allandeutschcom-note-images/a6f2e6d3392a126e500f3060fd0978bc.png)

* I like the curved wall and the rounded texture on it

![image](https://img.allandeutsch.com/allandeutschcom-note-images/d3b4de1415f9cb973b565e0d2e5de0f5.png)

* I love how many curves are introduced to soften what would otherwise be a very angular space
* I love the intimacy of the sunken walk-around living area; could we raise the area around the living room seating to create a similar effect?
* I like the fluted siding of the island and the natural stone flooring

![image](https://img.allandeutsch.com/allandeutschcom-note-images/11493a109f34fa97ecc30891eb69ad40.png)

* The restraint used in the materials palette is understated and beautiful
* I quite like the walk around living room setup
* I like that the surrounding floor is close to flush with the sofa back and could provide alternative & additional seating options
* maybe a pebble or river rock floor in the sunken area?

![image](https://img.allandeutsch.com/allandeutschcom-note-images/3c824f72cc62a80f445795d4b320e72d.png)

* The hidden lighting under the stairs and behind the ceiling provide nice ambient lighting and visual warmth to an otherwise stark space
* the illuminated stairs leading to the raised floor make the space feel meaningful/significant

![image](https://img.allandeutsch.com/allandeutschcom-note-images/d46475503c50a9fc47b7ee2bd4213fd6.png)

* Office space is cozy with the dark overhead wood
* Office spaces can be very small and still retain the full functionality
* The glass doors let light through while still offering noise isolation during meetings
* Love all the built in storage that could be used for office supplies, device charging, etc.
* Pleasant backdrop for video calls that will never be cluttered
