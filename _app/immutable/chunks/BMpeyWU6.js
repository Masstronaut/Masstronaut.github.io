*Giving unprompted advice is ineffective*. To influence people into following advice:-:lead them to ask for it with guiding questions. <!--SR:!2023-04-06,414,270-->

Instead of giving someone advice, ask them for advice on how others in a similar situation should tackle it. Doing so boosts their self esteem, making them responsible for the ideas they generate. Since people feel obligated to follow-through on their *Commitment and consistency*, they will be more likely to follow their own advice.

When someone asks for advice, they are *more likely* to follow it than if the advice were:-:unsolicited. <!--SR:!2022-10-13,367,330-->

Guiding people to ask for advice has 3 key benefits:
:--:

1. It reduces the likelihood of them becoming defensive
1. *Unsolicited advice decreases the confidence of the recipient*. Conversely, asking them for advice *increases* their confidence.
1. It helps *Bring the audience through the journey of a decision* <!--SR:!2022-10-30,162,190-->

Even if there's a clear solution, it's important for someone to go through the journey of discovering it. Doing so helps form the connection between the problem and the solution, increasing internalization and buy-in.
