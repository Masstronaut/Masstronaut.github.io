These days most of my CSS is written as inline Tailwindcss classes, and I’ll use vanilla CSS for anything that feels complicated or overly verbose to do in tailwind.</li> <li>TypeScript is my preference for interactivity &amp; logic. My background is in C and C++, so working in vanilla JS without type information is really difficult for me.

I’m starting to migrate projects from svelte 4 to svelte 5 and first impressions have been great.</li> <li>Sveltekit is a natural pairing for a svelte frontend that needs a lightweight backend. It’s got pretty good end-to-end type safety and I feel it has sensible defaults. My only real complaint is that I find it a little annoying to manage component logic that should be run exclusively on the client vs client and server.</li> <li>Vite has been great. Easy to write plugins, works well, works quickly, and development seems to closely mirror production. It’s a dev server I don’t have to think about much, and that’s wonderful.</li> <li>Vitest has been a great test runner. I love that it shares my vite config as maintaining multiple versions of environment config is horrible. I use it to run all my tests.</li> <li>Storybook is a tool I’m really excited about, but that prior to svelte 5 felt like it wasn’t quite there yet <em>for svelte components</em>. The new svelte 5 API has been awesome to work with on the first project I’m migrating from svelte 4 to 5 and I’m excited to integrate storybook more into my development workflow.</li> <li>I use Git/GitHub for version control. I recently watched a talk about <a href="https://www.janestreet.com/tech-talks/janestreet-code-review/" rel="nofollow">how Jane Street does code reviews</a> and I’m interested in exploring what else might be out there for the code review experience. Their concept of a “brain” (a diff of what diffs have been reviewed) seems really interesting.</li> <li>Static deployments on GitHub Pages and server-backed deployments on Vercel has been working well for me. They just work, and that’s fantastic. I am looking to try out <a href="https://coolify.io/" rel="nofollow">coolify</a> on a dedicated server though. I think serverless has some great properties for scaling, but also some major downsides and complexity. I want to explore affordable long-running servers to back low scale projects as it seems the DX may have caught up.</li> <li>Static analysis tools are magic because they reduce the cognitive burden of writing great code. Often the rules have been written by thoughtful engineers with a deep understanding of the technologies they are linting, and can be a great way to catch bugs before they happen. I use ESLint and typescript-eslint and am thrilled to have them.</li> <li>Similarly, formatting/code style is not something I want to think about.
