In addition to class, there were also assignments and projects that could be worked on whenever I wanted, as long as they were completed by the due date. In a typical week at DigiPen (where I did my undergrad), most students would spend around 25 hours in class and another 30-60 hours on homework and projects. Not all weeks had the same workload, but school definitely dominated the week for all students.

While most people looked forward to this future, I rather enjoyed student life.",B,b,re="During the nearly 20 years of school completed by most white collar workers prior to entering the workforce, the structure of a day looks very different from student life. Classes, unlike meetings, are punctuated by break periods of 5-10 minutes every hour. As students grow older, their schedules gain flexibility and education time shifts from being spent in class to doing homework and projects independently. There are regularly schedule breaks - winter break, spring break, and summer break. The latter of which is months long - a single break with more time off than is typical for most workers to have in an entire year. Time to explore new hobbies, learn things you are uniquely interested in, relax, and travel.
