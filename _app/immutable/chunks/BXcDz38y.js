When starting something new, it can be tempting to build infrastructure and supporting pieces early on. That infrastructure - once built - can reduce the friction of the activity. There are a few problems with doing so too early though:

* Building infrastructure for an activity is time taken away from actually *doing* the activity
* Without some experience doing the activity, it's hard to determine what infrastructure is truly valuable
* Building infrastructure isn't progress, whereas doing the activity is
* The activity may not be continued long term, and the infrastructure is unlikely to be a worthwhile investment in the short term

When lack of infrastructure becomes painful, it creates clarity about:-:what problems the infrastructure needs to solve.  <!--SR:!2022-05-28,154,250-->

Once it becomes clear than an activity is going to continue, *Automation unlocks progressively more meaningful problems*.
