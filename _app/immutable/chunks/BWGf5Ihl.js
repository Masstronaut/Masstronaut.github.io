Unfortunately, many special characters, include spaces, aren’t valid in a URL and need to be encoded. Spaces get encoded as <code>%20</code>, which is hard to read. If I had used this page’s title as its slug, it would be encoded as <code>slugs%20make%20links%20readable</code>. Gross!</p> <p>Instead, I define a custom slug for my published notes that doesn’t use characters requiring encoding. No apostrophes, accents, or spaces for me! This page for example has the slug <code>slugs-make-links-readable</code>. It’s not perfect, but it’s a lot easier on the eyes than the version gunked up with a bunch of <code>%20</code>s in it!</p> <p>This is why sites and publishers online will typically use a hyphen or underscore in the slug; it’s more readable! That readability isn’t just for humans, either. Search engines prefer content that they think will be easier for a human to read too.</p>",1);function R(s,a){const t=d(a,["children","$$slots","$$events","$$legacy"]);p(s,c(()=>t,e,{children:(i,h)=>{var o=u();n(4),l(i,o)},$$slots:{default:!0}}))}export{R as default,e as metadata};
