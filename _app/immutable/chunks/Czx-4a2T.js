In the study of [microeconomics](microeconomics.md) it can be helpful to quantify the utility value of goods. This is done using a theoretical unit of measurement called a:-:**util**. <!--SR:!2022-09-11,264,290-->

When the value of goods is quantified as utils, it makes it easier to model:-:consumer behavior. <!--SR:!2022-09-01,254,310-->

As the consumed quantity of a good increases, the value of each good tends to decrease. The value of one more of a good is called [marginal utility](marginal-utility.md). *Utils* can be used to quantify and model changes to [marginal utility](marginal-utility.md) of a good at different consumption levels.
