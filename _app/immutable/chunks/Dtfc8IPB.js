*Segmentation* is about dividing consumers into groups, called [customer segments](customer-segment.md), based on what they value.

Targeting is about determining which of the [customer segments](customer-segment.md) to focus on in marketing efforts to achieve a high *Return on Marketing Investment (ROMI)*. The targeted customer segments should be selected to maximize long-term profit. Consider factors such as:

* Likelihood to convert/purchase
* Cost to serve
* Price sensitivity
* Segment size
* Expected segment growth
* Competitors' ability to serve the segment
* Our ability to serve the segment
* Whether to focus on B2B or B2C

Defining how a product/service should be perceived by customers in the target [customer segment](customer-segment.md) is called:-: **positioning**. <!--SR:!2022-09-15,268,286-->
