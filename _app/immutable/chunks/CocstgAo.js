Factors of competition are the areas that businesses within an industry provide value to customers. When the emphasis companies place on these value areas is plotted on a [Strategy canvas](strategy-canvas.md), it creates the [value curve](value-curve.md).

Some examples of factors of competition are:

* Price
* Durability
* Eco-friendliness
* Technical specs
* Ease of use

In a [Red ocean](red-ocean.md), business compete by differentiating themselves with varying levels of emphasis on the factors of competition. They typically follow the **value-cost trade-off** where changes in emphasis on the factors result in directly proportional changes in cost - whether up or down. The most common way to differentiate is lower value and cost products vs higher value and cost products.

[Blue oceans](blue-ocean.md) are created when companies create new factors of competition and reduce costs - [value innovation](value-innovation.md).
