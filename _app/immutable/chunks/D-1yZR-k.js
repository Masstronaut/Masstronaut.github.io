Maya is in San Francisco for work, a trip in the making for a couple months. I really wanted to go, but she didn‚Äôt have a date until tickets were really expensive, and it felt too rushed with me exhibiting at <a href="https://cascadiajs.com" rel="nofollow">CascadiaJS</a> next week. I opted not to go this time, so it‚Äôs been a little bit lonely at home alone all week.</p> <p>Fortunately, I have a ton of awesome friends who meet up to cowork with me! Monday had gorgeous weather, so I biked along the water to University District and worked from <a href="https://maps.app.goo.gl/ZNJweuMLWXXxJG5j8" rel="nofollow">Leon Coffee House</a> and later <a href="https://maps.app.goo.gl/YCnLQ7YY1reJBE898" rel="nofollow">Saint Bread</a> with Taylor, who confirmed that the Saint Bread cheeseburger is amazing. Then on Thursday I met up with Hannah for a picnic in Cal Anderson park before walking over to <a href="https://maps.app.goo.gl/uKfuKtXbAeGtDL5f6" rel="nofollow">Basecamp cafe</a> for a work session.</p> <img src="https://img.allandeutsch.com/allandeutschcom-note-images/0dbdc3772960dff7a1cc36a24be4b7f8.png" alt="image"/> <!> <p>Some pretty exciting news this week: I got into <a href="https://buildspace.so" rel="nofollow">buildspace</a>! <img src="https://sage.buildspace.so/_next/image?url=%2Fimages%2Fa_erevald_2.png&amp;w=640&amp;q=75&amp;dpl=dpl_8kpvU9shQED65kfcTic6gUaTqBM7"/></p> <p>My friend <a href="https://x.com/lettucelettucel" rel="nofollow">Jon</a> also got into buildspace, and I‚Äôm excited to see what we‚Äôve both made at the end of the 6 weeks!</p> <p>A few weeks ago in <a href="/devlog/4#doc-duck">devlog 4 > Doc Duck</a> I mentioned that I had applied to buildspace. I love what Farza & the team are creating - a community of people who are building things because they want to and are excited about building them. It has an AI called ‚Äúsage‚Äù which is similar to linkedin, if linkedin had the vibe of a college campus that only allowed people in if they are excited to build things. I‚Äôve had a few people reach out to me, I‚Äôve reached out to a few people, and I‚Äôm curious what, if anything, will come of it.</p> <!> <p>In preparation for my booth at <a href="https://cascadiajs.com" rel="nofollow">CascadiaJS</a> I wanted revisit the initial feedback widget I made for Doc Duck. It was functional, but didn‚Äôt correctly respond to light/dark mode, lacked Doc Duck branding, and didn‚Äôt have a link to the <a href="https://docduck.dev" rel="nofollow">Doc Duck</a> website. Here‚Äôs a quick demo of the new widget:</p> <video autoplay loop><source src="https://img.allandeutsch.com/allandeutschcom-note-images/4b8ac68d91bdf74d44a159d0be651846.mp4" type="video/mp4" media="(prefers-color-scheme: light )"/> <source src="https://img.allandeutsch.com/allandeutschcom-note-images/9ad4b5cb83f2d79f8495852348213bec.mp4" type="video/mp4" media="(prefers-color-scheme: dark )"/> I'm sorry! Your browser doesn't support MP4 videos and can't play the demo for you.</video> <p>This video is a huge step up in quality from what I‚Äôve got on <a href="https://docduck.dev" rel="nofollow">Doc Duck</a> today. I haven‚Äôt been spending hours grinding to level up my video skills; I found <a href="https://screen.studio" rel="nofollow">Screen studio</a> and it produces aesthetic videos out of the box!</p> <p>I think the new widget looks great in both light and dark mode!</p> <p>I‚Äôve also got CascadiaJS coming up next week, and I have a few things remaining for it:</p> <ul class="contains-task-list"><li class="task-list-item"><input type="checkbox" disabled/> 90 second pitch to the entire conference üò±</li> <li class="task-list-item"><input type="checkbox" disabled/> Put together a live demo to show at my booth</li> <li class="task-list-item"><input type="checkbox" disabled/> Record a demo video to play on a screen for people walking by</li> <li class="task-list-item"><input type="checkbox" disabled/> Order Doc Duck booth decorations</li></ul> <p>Back to work!</p>`,3);function Z(p,h){const u=k(h,["children","$$slots","$$events","$$legacy"]);y(p,v(()=>u,()=>c,{children:(m,x)=>{var s=I(),l=a(b(s),6);r(l,{id:"build-space",children:(e,g)=>{i();var t=n("Build space");o(e,t)},$$slots:{default:!0}});var d=a(l,8);r(d,{id:"doc-duck",children:(e,g)=>{i();var t=n("Doc Duck");o(e,t)},$$slots:{default:!0}});var f=a(d,4);f.muted=!0,i(10),o(m,s)},$$slots:{default:!0}}))}export{Z as default,c as metadata};
