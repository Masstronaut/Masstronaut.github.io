A positioning statement defines how the team and customers should think about the product/service within the market compared to its competitors. Generally a positioning statement is written in the final step of [Segmentation, Targeting, and Positioning (STP)](segmentation-targeting-positioning.md).

A positioning statement should include these 6 elements:
:--:

1. The target [customer segment](customer-segment.md)
1. The unmet needs and wants of those customers
1. What the product is
1. A key benefit of the product
1. Alternatives to the product
1. Why the product is better than the alternative <!--SR:!2022-08-09,147,190-->

This template is a good starting point for crafting a positioning statement:

* For \\[*Target customers*\\]
* Who are dissatisfied with \\[*products they have used*\\]
* our product is a \\[*Product type or category*\\]
* that provides \\[*key benefit*\\]
* Unlike \\[*competing products*\\]
* we have \\[*features that competing products don't have*\\]

Some products have multiple customers, such as those with a *Multisided market* or *Segmented market*. When that's the case, it's best to have a different positioning statement for each side or segment of the market.
