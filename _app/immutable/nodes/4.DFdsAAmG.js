							Something had to change!</p> <p>There was really only one viable path forward after accounting
							for budget and timeline constraints. I had to propose the obvious
							solution: &quot;Feature teams could write their own docs!&quot; It wasn&#39;t a
							popular suggestion among the feature team engineering leadership,
							but nobody else had a solution.</p> <p>To set the feature teams up for success, I helped the docs team
							put together resources to set the feature teams up for success:
							templates, examples, training sessions, and a review process. I
							worked with release management to make quality docs a gating
							factor for releasing features. That&#39;s one way to solve the
							philosophical question!</p> <p>This approach turned out to be the right solution long-term.
							Nobody knows a feature better than its author, and once the dev
							had written the meat of a doc they were able to pair with a writer
							on making it easier to find and understand. This culture change
							resulted in a longer-term trend towards better quality docs and
							better docs coverage.</p>`;return{c(){e=p("div"),e.innerHTML=n,this.h()},l(t){e=g(t,"DIV",{slot:!0,"data-svelte-h":!0}),$(e)!=="svelte-19yg3jw"&&(e.innerHTML=n),this.h()},h(){i(e,"slot","content")},m(t,o){c(t,e,o)},p:w,d(t){t&&r(e)}}}function Te(a){let e,n,t,o,s,f,l,v;return e=new H({props:{$$slots:{content:[_e],heading:[ve]},$$scope:{ctx:a}}}),t=new H({props:{$$slots:{content:[be],heading:[ye]},$$scope:{ctx:a}}}),s=new H({props:{$$slots:{content:[Ce],heading:[xe]},$$scope:{ctx:a}}}),l=new H({props:{$$slots:{content:[ke],heading:[Ie]},$$scope:{ctx:a}}}),{c(){C(e.$$.fragment),n=M(),C(t.$$.fragment),o=M(),C(s.$$.fragment),f=M(),C(l.$$.fragment)},l(u){I(e.$$.fragment,u),n=D(u),I(t.$$.fragment,u),o=D(u),I(s.$$.fragment,u),f=D(u),I(l.$$.fragment,u)},m(u,_){k(e,u,_),c(u,n,_),k(t,u,_),c(u,o,_),k(s,u,_),c(u,f,_),k(l,u,_),v=!0},p(u,_){const d={};_&1&&(d.$$scope={dirty:_,ctx:u}),e.$set(d);const y={};_&1&&(y.$$scope={dirty:_,ctx:u}),t.$set(y);const h={};_&1&&(h.$$scope={dirty:_,ctx:u}),s.$set(h);const m={};_&1&&(m.$$scope={dirty:_,ctx:u}),l.$set(m)},i(u){v||(b(e.$$.fragment,u),b(t.$$.fragment,u),b(s.$$.fragment,u),b(l.$$.fragment,u),v=!0)},o(u){x(e.$$.fragment,u),x(t.$$.fragment,u),x(s.$$.fragment,u),x(l.$$.fragment,u),v=!1},d(u){u&&(r(n),r(o),r(f)),T(e,u),T(t,u),T(s,u),T(l,u)}}}function He(a){let e,n="Game Developer Experience PM";return{c(){e=p("h3"),e.textContent=n,this.h()},l(t){e=g(t,"H3",{class:!0,slot:!0,"data-svelte-h":!0}),$(e)!=="svelte-1ffxell"&&(e.textContent=n),this.h()},h(){i(e,"class","mt-0"),i(e,"slot","heading")},m(t,o){c(t,e,o)},p:w,d(t){t&&r(e)}}}function Me(a){let e,n=`<p>&quot;Whatever it takes to make sure game developers can successfully
