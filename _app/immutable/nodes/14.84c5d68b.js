We worked through a couple modules on form validation and accessibility. Most of it was refresher for me, but one new thing I learned is that form elements can have a <code>novalidate</code> attribute set. This is handy when using client-side validation with something like zod. Once JS is loaded on the page, using <code>novalidate</code> in a form stops the browser from handling validation, fully handing it over to JS. I think this is a great way to get the benefits of the browser when needed, and progressively enhance the experience with my own validation &amp; error handling if client-side JS is available.',q,T,te='This week is exciting to me for another reason! One of the most fulfilling things I’ve done as a software engineer is in fact not software engineering at all. As an undergrad student, I had the good fortune to be a volunteer at C++Now and a speaker at CppCon, two amazing C++ conferences. I also went on to present a talk a C++Now after graduating. My work as a PM moved me away from C++, so I haven’t been to a C++ conference since. I absolutely adored my time with the C++ committee and at conferences, though, and have yearned for something similar ever since. At Microsoft, I helped run conferences but was not a presenter in them. Recently I discovered that there is a Seattle JS meetup, and started attending their events. My very first time, one of the organizers asked people to submit presentation proposals even if it’s just a lightning talk, and so I did. This week, I’m thrilled to have been confirmed as a speaker at the May Seattle JS Meetup, where I will be presenting about <a href="https://allandeutsch.com/notes/structural-branded-types-nominal/" rel="nofollow">type branding</a> in TypeScript.
